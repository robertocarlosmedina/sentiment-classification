2322	neutral	Just plain silly .
7102	positive	This time , the hype is quieter , and while the movie is slightly less successful than the first , it 's still a rollicking good time for the most part .
8101	negative	The plot is plastered with one Hollywood cliche after another , most of which involve precocious kids getting the better of obnoxious adults .
6426	negative	Instead of a witty expose on the banality and hypocrisy of too much kid-vid , we get an ugly , mean-spirited lashing out by an adult who 's apparently been forced by his kids to watch too many Barney videos .

5249	positive	Filled with honest performances and exceptional detail , Baran is a gentle film with dramatic punch , a haunting ode to humanity .
4452	negative	Brisk hack job .
7408	positive	It 's too harsh to work as a piece of storytelling , but as an intellectual exercise -- an unpleasant debate that 's been given the drive of a narrative and that 's been acted out -- The Believer is nothing less than a provocative piece of work .

4060	negative	After seeing the film , I can tell you that there 's no other reason why anyone should bother remembering it .
6881	positive	Directors Brett Morgen and Nanette Burstein have put together a bold biographical fantasia .
5201	negative	The film feels formulaic , its plot and pacing typical Hollywood war-movie stuff , while the performances elicit more of a sense of deja vu than awe .
7070	negative	... the kind of movie you see because the theater has air conditioning .
6167	positive	A confluence of kiddie entertainment , sophisticated wit and symbolic graphic design .
3472	negative	Adroit but finally a trifle flat , Mad Love does n't galvanize its outrage the way , say , Jane Campion might have done , but at least it possesses some .

3125	positive	The cast is phenomenal , especially the women .
8140	neutral	Gambling and throwing a basketball game for money is n't a new plot -- in fact Toback himself used it in Black and White .

4249	positive	One of the best films I have ever seen , constantly pulling the rug from underneath us , seeing things from new sides , plunging deeper , getting more intense .
4636	neutral	The director and her capable cast appear to be caught in a heady whirl of New Age-inspired good intentions , but the spell they cast is n't the least bit mesmerizing .
6935	positive	The film 's strength is n't in its details , but in the larger picture it paints - of a culture in conflict with itself , with the thin veneer of nationalism that covers our deepest , media-soaked fears .
474	positive	An emotionally strong and politically potent piece of cinema .
7164	positive	A venturesome , beautifully realized psychological mood piece that reveals its first-time feature director 's understanding of the expressive power of the camera .
5693	positive	This rich , bittersweet Israeli documentary , about the life of song-and-dance-man Pasach ` ke Burstein and his family , transcends ethnic lines .
6501	neutral	It 's almost as if it 's an elaborate dare more than a full-blooded film .
2147	negative	You do n't need to know your Ice-T 's from your Cool-J 's to realize that as far as these shootings are concerned , something is rotten in the state of California .
8383	negative	After a while , the only way for a reasonably intelligent person to get through The Country Bears is to ponder how a whole segment of pop-music history has been allowed to get wet , fuzzy and sticky .

340	negative	Roman Polanski directs The Pianist like a surgeon mends a broken heart ; very meticulously but without any passion .

3233	neutral	Not a bad premise , but the execution is lackluster at best .
4024	neutral	The characters are interesting and the relationship between Yosuke and Saeko is worth watching as it develops , but there 's not enough to the story to fill two hours .

6280	positive	Ken Russell would love this .

5841	negative	That such a horrible movie could have sprung from such a great one is one of the year 's worst cinematic tragedies .
614	neutral	The movie strains to stay on the light , comic side of the issue , despite the difficulty of doing so when dealing with the destruction of property and , potentially , of life itself .
4239	positive	The performances are amiable and committed , and the comedy more often than not hits the bullseye .
3881	neutral	Stuart 's poor-me persona needs a whole bunch of Snowball 's cynicism to cut through the sugar coating .
8489	negative	For all its brilliant touches , Dragon loses its fire midway , nearly flickering out by its perfunctory conclusion .
4232	positive	What enlivens this film , beyond the astute direction of Cardoso and beautifully detailed performances by all of the actors , is a note of defiance over social dictates .
1559	positive	A sun-drenched masterpiece , part parlor game , part psychological case study , part droll social satire .
3113	neutral	But , no , we get another scene , and then another .
452	negative	Even with its $ 50-million US budget , Pinocchio never quite achieves the feel of a fanciful motion picture .

3435	negative	I do n't think most of the people who loved the 1989 Paradiso will prefer this new version .
2910	neutral	The philosophical musings of the dialogue jar against the tawdry soap opera antics of the film 's action in a way that is surprisingly enjoyable .
6292	negative	Stealing Harvard will dip into your wallet , swipe 90 minutes of your time , and offer you precisely this in recompense : A few early laughs scattered around a plot as thin as it is repetitious .
4746	negative	It collapses when Mr. Taylor tries to shift the tone to a thriller 's rush .
6019	neutral	A well-acted movie that simply does n't gel .
4327	neutral	Goldmember is funny enough to justify the embarrassment of bringing a barf bag to the moviehouse .
187	negative	There 's a great deal of corny dialogue and preposterous moments .

6041	negative	Too often , Son of the Bride becomes an exercise in trying to predict when a preordained `` big moment '' will occur and not `` if . ''
1590	neutral	The kind of sense of humor that derives from a workman 's grasp of pun and entendre and its attendant need to constantly draw attention to itself .
4964	neutral	This is NOT a retread of `` Dead Poets ' Society . ''
6127	negative	As a remake , it 's a pale imitation .
8173	positive	Singer\/composer Bryan Adams contributes a slew of songs -- a few potential hits , a few more simply intrusive to the story -- but the whole package certainly captures the intended , er , spirit of the piece .
6233	neutral	The film favors the scientific over the spectacular -LRB- visually speaking -RRB- .
4443	neutral	Your appreciation of it will depend on what experiences you bring to it and what associations you choose to make .
1002	negative	An incredibly irritating comedy about thoroughly vacuous people ... manages to embody the worst excesses of nouvelle vague without any of its sense of fun or energy .
1375	neutral	Does little to elaborate the conceit of setting this blood-soaked tragedy of murderous ambition in the era of Richard Nixon .
8412	negative	Yet it 's not quite the genre-busting film it 's been hyped to be because it plays everything too safe .
5839	neutral	This is a nervy , risky film , and Villeneuve has inspired Croze to give herself over completely to the tormented persona of Bibi .
797	positive	... the tale of her passionate , tumultuous affair with Musset unfolds as Sand 's masculine persona , with its love of life and beauty , takes form .
4841	positive	A tightly directed , highly professional film that 's old-fashioned in all the best possible ways .
7455	negative	Watching `` Ending '' is too often like looking over the outdated clothes and plastic knickknacks at your neighbor 's garage sale .
6023	positive	If the plot seems a bit on the skinny side , that 's because Panic Room is interested in nothing more than sucking you in ... and making you sweat .
2705	negative	This long and relentlessly saccharine film is a clear case of preaching to the converted .
98	negative	Report card : Does n't live up to the exalted tagline - there 's definite room for improvement .
2888	positive	Though overall an overwhelmingly positive portrayal , the film does n't ignore the more problematic aspects of Brown 's life .

7233	positive	One of those exceedingly rare films in which the talk alone is enough to keep us involved .
5098	positive	A deliberative account of a lifestyle characterized by its surface-obsession -- one that typifies the delirium of post , pre , and extant stardom .
3379	negative	Equlibrium could pass for a thirteen-year-old 's book report on the totalitarian themes of 1984 and Farenheit 451 .
5183	positive	The footage of the rappers at play and the prison interview with Suge Knight are just two of the elements that will grab you .
923	positive	Satin Rouge is not a new , or inventive , journey , but it 's encouraging to see a three-dimensional , average , middle-aged woman 's experience of self-discovery handled with such sensitivity .
2200	positive	A flawed but engrossing thriller .
7793	neutral	Oliveira seems to pursue silent film representation with every mournful composition .
3986	positive	When the movie mixes the cornpone and the Cosa Nostra , it finds a nice rhythm .
1003	negative	Wait to see it then .
4553	neutral	Ice Age posits a heretofore unfathomable question : Is it possible for computer-generated characters to go through the motions ?
5480	negative	Though Tom Shadyac 's film kicks off spookily enough , around the halfway mark it takes an abrupt turn into glucose sentimentality and laughable contrivance .
4040	neutral	If this silly little cartoon can inspire a few kids not to grow up to be greedy bastards , more power to it .
6837	positive	The determination of Pinochet 's victims to seek justice , and their often heartbreaking testimony , spoken directly into director Patricio Guzman 's camera , pack a powerful emotional wallop .
7302	negative	Without any redeeming value whatsoever .

6282	neutral	Bang !
4569	negative	It 's just plain lurid when it is n't downright silly .
3648	negative	It is too bad that this likable movie is n't more accomplished .
1445	negative	This wretchedly unfunny wannabe comedy is inane and awful - no doubt , it 's the worst movie I 've seen this summer .
2648	negative	While it is welcome to see a Chinese film depict a homosexual relationship in a mature and frank fashion , Lan Yu never catches dramatic fire .
3056	negative	A summary of the plot does n't quite do justice to the awfulness of the movie , for that comes through all too painfully in the execution .
2772	positive	The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys ' take on adolescence feels painfully true .

2945	negative	The catch is that they 're stuck with a script that prevents them from firing on all cylinders .
2774	negative	Why sit through a crummy , wannabe-hip crime comedy that refers incessantly to old movies , when you could just rent those movies instead , let alone seek out a respectable new one ?
6886	negative	-LRB- MacDowell -RRB- ventures beyond her abilities several times here and reveals how bad an actress she is .

7897	positive	Cannon 's confidence and laid-back good spirits are , with the drumming routines , among the film 's saving graces .

7141	negative	It 's a mystery how the movie could be released in this condition .
533	neutral	This one is strictly a lightweight escapist film .

1541	positive	It never quite makes it to the boiling point , but manages to sustain a good simmer for most of its running time .

1810	positive	-LRB- Shyamalan -RRB- turns the goose-pimple genre on its empty head and fills it with spirit , purpose and emotionally bruised characters who add up to more than body count .
3376	negative	Klein , charming in comedies like American Pie and dead-on in Election , delivers one of the saddest action hero performances ever witnessed .
5618	positive	Dark and unrepentant , this excursion into the epicenter of percolating mental instability is not easily dismissed or forgotten .
3023	neutral	Despite a performance of sustained intelligence from Stanford and another of subtle humour from Bebe Neuwirth , as an older woman who seduces Oscar , the film founders on its lack of empathy for the social milieu - rich New York intelligentsia - and its off

6749	positive	It 's funny , as the old saying goes , because it 's true .
1931	negative	Lisa Rinzler 's cinematography may be lovely , but Love Liza 's tale itself virtually collapses into an inhalant blackout , maintaining consciousness just long enough to achieve callow pretension .

515	negative	Proves a lovely trifle that , unfortunately , is a little too in love with its own cuteness .
4598	negative	Though it 's not very well shot or composed or edited , the score is too insistent and the dialogue is frequently overwrought and crudely literal , the film shatters you in waves .

8151	negative	Jaw-droppingly superficial , straining to get by on humor that is not even as daring as John Ritter 's glory days on Three 's Company .
8497	neutral	Reno does what he can in a thankless situation , the film ricochets from humor to violence and back again , and Ryoko Hirosue makes us wonder if she is always like that .

6676	positive	Wickedly funny , visually engrossing , never boring , this movie challenges us to think about the ways we consume pop culture .
7920	positive	The stars may be college kids , but the subject matter is as adult as you can get : the temptations of the flesh are unleashed by a slightly crazed , overtly determined young woman and a one-night swim turns into an ocean of trouble .

4760	positive	It reaffirms life as it looks in the face of death .
6182	negative	Franco is an excellent choice for the walled-off but combustible hustler , but he does not give the transcendent performance SONNY needs to overcome gaps in character development and story logic .

1737	negative	Nair just does n't have the necessary self-control to guide a loose , poorly structured film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy .
3263	neutral	This is a picture that Maik , the firebrand turned savvy ad man , would be envious of : it hijacks the heat of revolution and turns it into a sales tool .
8544	neutral	The film is darkly atmospheric , with Herrmann quietly suggesting the sadness and obsession beneath Hearst 's forced avuncular chortles .
1887	negative	The trouble with making this queen a thoroughly modern maiden is that it also makes her appear foolish and shallow rather than , as was more likely , a victim of mental illness .
8082	negative	Weighted down with slow , uninvolving storytelling and flat acting .
2926	neutral	Fulfills the minimum requirement of Disney animation .

5745	negative	The whole movie is simply a lazy exercise in bad filmmaking that asks you to not only suspend your disbelief but your intelligence as well .
7902	neutral	The pitch must have read like a discarded House Beautiful spread .
6799	negative	Its simplicity puts an exclamation point on the fact that this is n't something to be taken seriously , but it also wrecks any chance of the movie rising above similar fare .
168	neutral	A well-made but emotionally scattered film whose hero gives his heart only to the dog .
2000	positive	The kind of movie that comes along only occasionally , one so unconventional , gutsy and perfectly executed it takes your breath away .
3084	positive	Angela Gheorghiu as famous prima donna Floria Tosca , Roberto Alagna as her lover Mario Cavaradossi , and Ruggero as the villainous , lecherous police chief Scarpia , all sing beautifully and act adequately .
1021	positive	The mark of a respectable summer blockbuster is one of two things : unadulterated thrills or genuine laughs .
4994	positive	While the story 's undeniably hard to follow , Iwai 's gorgeous visuals seduce .
1137	positive	Continually challenges perceptions of guilt and innocence , of good guys and bad , and asks us whether a noble end can justify evil means .
6650	neutral	The Master of Disguise is funny -- not `` ha ha '' funny , `` dead circus performer '' funny .
7354	positive	A conventional but heartwarming tale .
5052	negative	It looks like an action movie , but it 's so poorly made , on all levels , that it does n't even qualify as a spoof of such .
2265	positive	Comedian , like its subjects , delivers the goods and audiences will have a fun , no-frills ride .
2783	negative	Koepp 's screenplay is n't nearly surprising or clever enough to sustain a reasonable degree of suspense on its own .
3198	positive	A jaw-droppingly beautiful work
7174	neutral	A brutally honest documentary about a much anticipated family reunion that goes wrong thanks to culture shock and a refusal to empathize with others .
191	positive	The dragons are the real stars of Reign of Fire and you wo n't be disappointed .
2354	negative	Contains a few big laughs but many more that graze the funny bone or miss it altogether , in part because the consciously dumbed-down approach wears thin .
2919	positive	A sharp , amusing study of the cult of celebrity .
3292	positive	It is an unstinting look at a collaboration between damaged people that may or may not qual
4265	neutral	A portrait of an artist .
937	negative	Full of flatulence jokes and mild sexual references , Kung Pow !
8033	positive	The film brilliantly shines on all the characters , as the direction is intelligently accomplished .
7907	negative	By the time you reach the finale , you 're likely wondering why you 've been watching all this strutting and posturing .
5951	neutral	Like the series , the movie is funny , smart , visually inventive , and most of all , alive .
978	positive	The Emperor 's Club , ruthless in its own placid way , finds one of our most conservative and hidebound movie-making traditions and gives it new texture , new relevance , new reality .
3670	positive	Her film
3636	neutral	Exploring value choices is a worthwhile topic for a film -- but here the choices are as contrived and artificial as Kerrigan 's platinum-blonde hair .
2805	negative	The comedy Death to Smoochy is a rancorous curiosity : a movie without an apparent audience .
2235	positive	None of this is meaningful or memorable , but frosting is n't , either , and you would n't turn down a big bowl of that , would you ?
6875	positive	Neil Burger here succeeded in ... making the mystery of four decades back the springboard for a more immediate mystery in the present .
7898	positive	The movie is hardly a masterpiece , but it does mark Ms. Bullock 's best work in some time .
6415	positive	An Inuit masterpiece that will give you goosebumps as its uncanny tale of love , communal discord , and justice unfolds .
5837	negative	Most of the movie is so deadly dull that watching the proverbial paint dry would be a welcome improvement .
4140	negative	... a cheap , ludicrous attempt at serious horror .
4866	neutral	Wiseman reveals the victims of domestic abuse in all of their pity and terror .
4355	negative	A simpler , leaner treatment would have been preferable ; after all , being about nothing is sometimes funnier than being about something .
7668	positive	An inventive , absorbing movie that 's as hard to classify as it is hard to resist .
2003	neutral	His best film remains his shortest , The Hole , which makes many of the points that this film does but feels less repetitive .
6128	positive	Fessenden has nurtured his metaphors at the expense of his narrative , but he does display an original talent .
2594	negative	The new film of Anton Chekhov 's The Cherry Orchard puts the ` ick ' in ` classic . '
1837	negative	It 's a mindless action flick with a twist -- far better suited to video-viewing than the multiplex .
5797	negative	Officially , it is twice as bestial but half as funny .
8067	positive	The film is bright and flashy in all the right ways .
4422	positive	Angel presents events partly from the perspective of Aurelie and Christelle , and infuses the film with the sensibility of a particularly nightmarish fairytale .
3180	positive	Fifty years after the fact , the world 's political situation seems little different , and -LRB- director Phillip -RRB- Noyce brings out the allegory with remarkable skill .
196	negative	The film can depress you about life itself .
4954	negative	Too bad writer-director Adam Rifkin situates it all in a plot as musty as one of the Golden Eagle 's carpets .
3969	positive	The attraction between these two marginal characters is complex from the start -- and , refreshingly , stays that way .
3234	neutral	... the same tired old gags , modernized for the extreme sports generation .
6604	positive	Remarkable for its intelligence and intensity .
6170	negative	Jacobi , the most fluent of actors , is given relatively dry material from Nijinsky 's writings to perform , and the visuals , even erotically frank ones , become dullingly repetitive .
2188	negative	Um ... is n't that the basis for the entire plot ?
3059	negative	... the story simply putters along looking for astute observations and coming up blank .
6896	negative	A fragile framework upon which to hang broad , mildly fleshed-out characters that seem to have been conjured up only 10 minutes prior to filming .
6562	positive	A stirring , funny and finally transporting re-imagining of Beauty and the Beast and 1930s horror films
3669	positive	It deserves to be seen everywhere .
7528	negative	An uneven mix of dark satire and childhood awakening .
7606	positive	Take nothing seriously and enjoy the ride .
3502	positive	Those who are n't put off by the film 's austerity will find it more than capable of rewarding them .
3529	positive	This in-depth study of important developments of the computer industry should make it required viewing in university computer science departments for years to come .
848	positive	Maintains your interest until the end and even leaves you with a few lingering animated thoughts .
5338	positive	It offers a glimpse of the Solomonic decision facing Jewish parents in those turbulent times : to save their children and yet to lose them .
6506	positive	A competent , unpretentious entertainment destined to fill the after-school slot at shopping mall theaters across the country .
5349	negative	With minimal imagination , you could restage the whole thing in your bathtub .
4880	positive	The film reminds me of a vastly improved Germanic version of My Big Fat Greek Wedding -- with better characters , some genuine quirkiness and at least a measure of style .
5331	neutral	just pile up .
2650	positive	A plethora of engaging diatribes on the meaning of ` home , ' delivered in grand passion by the members of the various households .
5234	negative	Predictably melodramatic .
3488	neutral	Do you say `` hi '' to your lover when you wake up in the morning ?
5350	negative	I 'm sorry to say that this should seal the deal - Arnold is not , nor will he be , back .
227	negative	It 's difficult to imagine that a more confused , less interesting and more sloppily made film could possibly come down the road in 2002 .
3391	positive	This is an exercise in chilling style , and Twohy films the sub , inside and out , with an eye on preserving a sense of mystery .
4119	negative	Director Uwe Boll and writer Robert Dean Klein fail to generate any interest in an unsympathetic hero caught up in an intricate plot that while cleverly worked out , can not overcome blah characters .
5206	neutral	The photographer 's show-don ` t-tell stance is admirable , but it can make him a problematic documentary subject .
7468	negative	How this one escaped the Lifetime network I 'll never know .
5256	positive	A fascinating , bombshell documentary that should shame Americans , regardless of whether or not ultimate blame finally lies with Kissinger .
2599	negative	Cinematic pyrotechnics aside , the only thing Avary seems to care about are mean giggles and pulchritude .
5915	negative	It 's hard to pity the ` plain ' girl who becomes a ravishing waif after applying a smear of lip-gloss .
4766	positive	Shyamalan offers copious hints along the way -- myriad signs , if you will -- that beneath the familiar , funny surface is a far bigger , far more meaningful story than one in which little green men come to Earth for harvesting purposes .
1472	negative	... while the humor aspects of ` Jason X ' were far more entertaining than I had expected , everything else about the film tanks .
3214	positive	About Schmidt is undoubtedly one of the finest films of the year .
4997	positive	Even if it pushes its agenda too forcefully , this remains a film about something , one that attempts and often achieves a level of connection and concern .
8136	positive	A dazzling thing to behold -- as long as you 're wearing the somewhat cumbersome 3D goggles the theater provides .
4726	negative	At some point , all this visual trickery stops being clever and devolves into flashy , vaguely silly overkill .
124	neutral	It 's the unsettling images of a war-ravaged land that prove more potent and riveting than the unlikely story of Sarah and Harrison .
1512	positive	Jackson is always watchable .
4189	positive	Daringly perceptive , taut , piercing and feisty , Biggie and Tupac is undeniably subversive and involving in its bold presentation .
3091	positive	... a gleefully grungy , hilariously wicked black comedy ...
3441	negative	There 's no point in extracting the bare bones of Byatt 's plot for purposes of bland Hollywood romance .
6769	negative	Solondz is without doubt an artist of uncompromising vision , but that vision is beginning to feel , if not morally bankrupt , at least terribly monotonous .
4415	negative	It 's bedeviled by labored writing and slack direction .
920	negative	An uncomfortable movie , suffocating and sometimes almost senseless , The Grey Zone does have a center , though a morbid one .
4045	positive	A whole lot of fun and funny in the middle , though somewhat less hard-hitting at the start and finish .
5777	positive	Those who trek to the ` plex predisposed to like it probably will enjoy themselves .
7191	neutral	This is the first full scale WWII flick from Hong Kong 's John Woo .
7989	positive	Diane Lane works nothing short of a minor miracle in Unfaithful .
4682	neutral	Works because we 're never sure if Ohlinger 's on the level or merely a dying , delusional man trying to get into the history books before he croaks .
1293	neutral	After the setup , the air leaks out of the movie , flattening its momentum with about an hour to go .
3477	neutral	Arnie blows things up .
6699	negative	Neither as scary-funny as Tremors nor demented-funny as Starship Troopers , the movie is n't tough to take as long as you 've paid a matinee price .
5005	neutral	Streamlined to a tight , brisk 85-minute screwball thriller , `` Big Trouble '' is funny , harmless and as substantial as a tub of popcorn with extra butter .
4075	neutral	Well-meaning to a fault , Antwone Fisher manages the dubious feat of turning one man 's triumph of will into everyman 's romance comedy .
6458	positive	It 's a great performance and a reminder of Dickens ' grandeur .
2277	positive	Meticulously uncovers a trail of outrageous force and craven concealment .
5997	neutral	Barely .
6316	positive	It 's sweet .
5883	positive	An effective portrait of a life in stasis -- of the power of inertia to arrest development in a dead-end existence .
4160	negative	A negligible British comedy .
1117	negative	Perry 's good and his is an interesting character , but `` Serving Sara '' has n't much more to serve than silly fluff .
5211	positive	Even before it builds up to its insanely staged ballroom scene , in which 3000 actors appear in full regalia , it 's waltzed itself into the art film pantheon .
7603	neutral	Too many improbabilities and rose-colored situations temper what could 've been an impacting film .
4706	neutral	An overwrought Taiwanese soaper about three people and their mixed-up relationship .
3829	neutral	Count on his movie to work at the back of your neck long after you leave the theater .
6288	negative	The film 's most improbable feat ?
6421	negative	Totally overwrought , deeply biased , and wholly designed to make you feel guilty about ignoring what the filmmakers clearly believe are The Greatest Musicians of All Time .
865	negative	A work that lacks both a purpose and a strong pulse .
5947	negative	works on the whodunit level as its larger themes get lost in the murk of its own making
8226	positive	Tully is worth a look for its true-to-life characters , its sensitive acting , its unadorned view of rural life and the subtle direction of first-timer Hilary Birmingham .
4622	neutral	Try Hell House , which documents the cautionary Christian spook-a-rama of the same name .
3555	negative	An already thin story boils down to surviving invaders seeking an existent anti-virus .
6151	negative	In the end , the film feels homogenized and a bit contrived , as if we 're looking back at a tattered and ugly past with rose-tinted glasses .
2285	positive	On the surface a silly comedy , Scotland , PA would be forgettable if it were n't such a clever adaptation of the bard 's tragic play .
8175	negative	Seriously , rent the Disney version .
2934	neutral	Routine and rather silly .
3923	positive	Great character interaction .

6856	positive	The leads are natural and lovely , the pace is serene , the humor wry and sprightly .
7508	negative	Amazingly lame .
2278	positive	A pretty funny movie , with most of the humor coming , as before , from the incongruous but chemically perfect teaming of Crystal and De Niro .
785	negative	It 's not a motion picture ; it 's an utterly static picture .
4550	neutral	Ali 's graduation from little screen to big is far less painful than his opening scene encounter with an over-amorous terrier .
7310	positive	A cultural wildcard experience : wacky , different , unusual , even nutty .
1120	negative	Watchable up until the point where the situations and the dialogue spin hopelessly out of control -- that is to say , when Carol Kane appears on the screen .
1625	neutral	There are things to like about Murder By Numbers -- but , in the end , the disparate elements do n't gel .
4450	positive	Hugh Grant 's act is so consuming that sometimes it 's difficult to tell who the other actors in the movie are .
5435	positive	An ambitious ` what if ? '
2477	negative	Showtime is n't particularly assaultive , but it can still make you feel that you never want to see another car chase , explosion or gunfight again .
5818	negative	Many went to see the attraction for the sole reason that it was hot outside and there was air conditioning inside , and I do n't think that A.C. will help this movie one bit .
1920	positive	A true-blue delight .
4583	negative	This is surely one of the most frantic , virulent and foul-natured Christmas season pics ever delivered by a Hollywood studio .
958	positive	An entertaining , if ultimately minor , thriller .
375	positive	Some movies suck you in despite their flaws , and Heaven is one such beast .
4451	positive	Although Frailty fits into a classic genre , in its script and execution it is a remarkably original work .
3662	positive	The formula is familiar but enjoyable .
1122	negative	`` -LRB- Hopkins -RRB- does n't so much phone in his performance as fax it .
503	neutral	The cast comes through even when the movie does n't .
7220	negative	With a `` Spy Kids '' sequel opening next week , why bother with a contemptible imitator starring a `` SNL '' has-been acting like an 8-year-old channeling Roberto Benigni ?
5304	neutral	... the implication is Kissinger may have decided that -- when it comes to truncheoning -- it 's better to give than to receive .
3663	negative	It is dark , brooding and slow , and takes its central idea way too seriously .
1415	negative	A brutally dry satire of Middle American numbness .
6839	positive	The Movie is clever , offbeat and even gritty enough to overcome my resistance .
1349	negative	This is a movie filled with unlikable , spiteful idiots ; whether or not their friendship is salvaged makes no difference in the least .
471	negative	Imagine a film that begins as a Seven rip-off , only to switch to a mix of The Shining , The Thing , and any naked teenagers horror flick from the 1980s .

371	negative	Translation : ` We do n't need to try very hard . '
4396	positive	A solidly entertaining little film .
2036	neutral	-LRB- It -RRB- highlights not so much the crime lord 's messianic bent , but Spacey 's .
6281	negative	Thumbs down .
4407	positive	Highlighted by a gritty style and an excellent cast , it 's better than one might expect when you look at the list of movies starring Ice-T in a major role .
6255	negative	Kung Pow seems like some futile concoction that was developed hastily after Oedekerk and his fellow moviemakers got through crashing a college keg party .
5022	positive	It 's a fun adventure movie for kids -LRB- of all ages -RRB- that like adventure .
2940	positive	There 's none of the happily-ever - after spangle of Monsoon Wedding in Late Marriage -- and that 's part of what makes Dover Kosashvili 's outstanding feature debut so potent .

2061	negative	Not even Felinni would know what to make of this Italian freakshow .
6961	positive	`` Extreme Ops '' exceeds expectations .

2168	positive	A giddy and provocative sexual romp that has something to say .
5129	neutral	A collage
5416	positive	-LRB- D -RRB- espite its familiar subject matter , Ice Age is consistently amusing and engrossing ...
4942	negative	A waterlogged version of ` Fatal Attraction ' for the teeny-bopper set ... a sad , soggy potboiler that wastes the talents of its attractive young leads .
1130	neutral	The film will appeal to Discovery Channel fans and will surely widen the perspective of those of us who see the continent through rose-colored glasses .
446	positive	A straight-shooting family film which awards animals the respect they 've rarely been given .

7562	positive	Everyone should be able to appreciate the wonderful cinematography and naturalistic acting .
1942	positive	Adaptation 's success in engaging the audience in the travails of creating a screenplay is extraordinary .

7036	negative	An inelegant combination of two unrelated shorts that falls far short of the director 's previous work in terms of both thematic content and narrative strength .
8534	negative	This movie ... does n't deserve the energy it takes to describe how bad it is .
3079	neutral	For a film that celebrates radical , nonconformist values , What to Do in Case of Fire ?
7097	neutral	When Mr. Hundert tells us in his narration that ` this is a story without surprises , ' we nod in agreement .
6287	positive	Like the best of Godard 's movies ... it is visually ravishing , penetrating , impenetrable .
6795	positive	A film centering on a traditional Indian wedding in contemporary New Delhi may not sound like specialized fare , but Mira Nair 's film is an absolute delight for all audiences .
272	positive	After the first 10 minutes , which is worth seeing
5120	negative	An excruciating demonstration of the unsalvageability of a movie saddled with an amateurish screenplay .
6589	neutral	Consider this review life-affirming .
4819	negative	The overall feel is not unlike watching a glorified episode of `` 7th Heaven . ''

247	negative	Feral and uncomfortable .
6429	positive	Making such a tragedy the backdrop to a love story risks trivializing it , though Chouraqui no doubt intended the film to affirm love 's power to help people endure almost unimaginable horror .
5332	positive	A brutal and funny work .

2507	neutral	Feels untidily honest .

5660	positive	... once the true impact of the day unfolds , the power of this movie is undeniable .
3805	negative	This overlong infomercial , due out on video before month 's end , is tepid and tedious .
4556	positive	There 's real visual charge to the filmmaking , and a strong erotic spark to the most crucial lip-reading sequence .
2758	neutral	In this film we at least see a study in contrasts ; the wide range of one actor , and the limited range of a comedian .
5422	positive	This documentary is a dazzling , remarkably unpretentious reminder of what -LRB- Evans -RRB- had , lost , and got back .
6508	negative	Feels at times like a giant commercial for Universal Studios , where much of the action takes place .
5559	neutral	While the new film is much more eye-catching than its blood-drenched Stephen Norrington-directed predecessor , the new script by the returning David S. Goyer is much sillier .
2440	positive	Combines a comically dismal social realism with a farcically bawdy fantasy of redemption and regeneration .

6477	positive	Psychologically savvy .
4533	neutral	Merchant has n't directed this movie so much as produced it -- like sausage .
3884	negative	If you 're looking to rekindle the magic of the first film , you 'll need a stronger stomach than us .

2859	positive	I can easily imagine Benigni 's Pinocchio becoming a Christmas perennial .
988	negative	Viewers are asked so often to suspend belief that were it not for Holm 's performance , the film would be a total washout .
4338	negative	Diane Lane 's sophisticated performance ca n't rescue Adrian Lyne 's Unfaithful from its sleazy moralizing .
5880	positive	The performances are immaculate , with Roussillon providing comic relief .

7701	negative	Although I did n't hate this one , it 's not very good either .
6942	negative	Occasionally loud and offensive , but more often , it simply lulls you into a gentle waking coma .
4285	negative	There 's an admirable rigor to Jimmy 's relentless anger , and to the script 's refusal of a happy ending , but as those monologues stretch on and on , you realize there 's no place for this story to go but down .
7893	positive	Claire is a terrific role for someone like Judd , who really ought to be playing villains .
7358	neutral	Blithely anachronistic and slyly achronological .
99	neutral	It 's not a particularly good film , but neither is it a monsterous one .
229	neutral	Jolting into Charleston rhythms , the story has the sizzle of old news that has finally found the right vent -LRB- accurate ?
182	positive	Like Smoke Signals , the film is also imbued with strong themes of familial ties and spirituality that are powerful and moving without stooping to base melodrama
5986	positive	A funny and touching film that is gorgeously acted by a British cast to rival Gosford Park 's .
6190	neutral	A feature-length , R-rated , road-trip version of Mama 's Family .

3996	neutral	This is mostly well-constructed fluff , which is all it seems intended to be .
4370	neutral	Anyone else seen this before ?
1	negative	A series of escapades demonstrating the adage that what is good for the goose is also good for the gander , some of which occasionally amuses but none of which amounts to much of a story .
6120	neutral	Quitting delivers a sucker-punch , and its impact is all the greater beause director Zhang 's last film , the cuddly Shower , was a non-threatening multi-character piece centered around a public bath house .
3785	negative	Quitting , however , manages just to be depressing , as the lead actor phones in his autobiographical performance .
6350	negative	Nohe has made a decent ` intro ' documentary , but he feels like a spectator and not a participant .
758	negative	Despite Juliet Stevenon 's attempt to bring cohesion to Pamela 's emotional roller coaster life , it is not enough to give the film the substance it so desperately needs .
7932	positive	Succeeds as a well-made evocation of a subculture .

1958	neutral	Famuyiwa 's feature

530	positive	... a powerful sequel and one of the best films of the year .
588	neutral	Show me the mugging .
58	positive	Mark Pellington 's latest pop thriller is as kooky and overeager as it is spooky and subtly in love with myth .
2118	positive	It 's rare to find a film to which the adjective ` gentle ' applies , but the word perfectly describes Pauline & Paulette .
6697	neutral	Apparently writer-director Attal thought he need only cast himself and his movie-star wife sitting around in their drawers to justify a film .
4821	neutral	This new Time Machine is hardly perfect ... yet it proves surprisingly serviceable .
4220	neutral	And how .
3285	negative	What the audience feels is exhaustion , from watching a movie that is dark -LRB- dark green , to be exact -RRB- , sour , bloody and mean .
7683	negative	Each story is built on a potentially interesting idea , but the first two are ruined by amateurish writing and acting , while the third feels limited by its short running time .
3414	negative	Pleasant but not more than recycled jock piffle .
3172	positive	A bit of a downer and a little over-dramatic at times , but this is a beautiful film for people who like their romances to have that French realism .
7044	negative	Leaks treacle from every pore .
1299	negative	Aloof and lacks any real raw emotion , which is fatal for a film that relies on personal relationships .
8161	negative	It is very difficult to care about the character , and that is the central flaw of the film .
2556	neutral	The most anti-human big studio picture since 3000 Miles to Graceland .
8284	neutral	Plods along , minus the twisted humor and eye-popping visuals that have made Miike ... a cult hero .
3345	negative	A dark-as-pitch comedy that frequently veers into corny sentimentality , probably would not improve much after a therapeutic zap of shock treatment .
7999	positive	One of the best of a growing strain of daring films ... that argue that any sexual relationship that does n't hurt anyone and works for its participants is a relationship that is worthy of our respect .
1868	neutral	Five screenwriters
2372	negative	An uneven look into a grim future that does n't come close to the level of intelligence and visual splendour that can be seen in other films based on Philip K. Dick stories .
7689	negative	Witless and utterly pointless .
909	negative	Lots of effort and intelligence are on display but in execution it is all awkward , static , and lifeless rumblings .
318	positive	It is a happy , heady jumble of thought and storytelling , an insane comic undertaking that ultimately coheres into a sane and breathtakingly creative film .
5174	negative	If only it had the story to match .
8522	positive	Exhilarating , funny and fun .
113	negative	The whole film has this sneaky feel to it -- as if the director is trying to dupe the viewer into taking it all as Very Important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a Hollywood product .
8174	negative	It 's a road-trip drama with too many wrong turns .
4493	positive	Nohe 's documentary about the event is sympathetic without being gullible : He is n't blind to the silliness , but also captures moments of spontaneous creativity and authentic co-operative interaction .
6884	negative	I did go back and check out the last 10 minutes , but these were more repulsive than the first 30 or 40 minutes .
5838	positive	That Haynes can both maintain and dismantle the facades that his genre and his character construct is a wonderous accomplishment of veracity and narrative grace .
6247	positive	Although shot with little style , Skins is heartfelt and achingly real .
3875	positive	Return to Never Land is reliable , standard Disney animated fare , with enough creative energy and wit to entertain all ages .
5547	neutral	Suffers from a decided lack of creative storytelling .
6756	positive	Fresh and raw like a blown-out vein , Narc takes a walking-dead , cop-flick subgenre and beats new life into it .
1788	negative	Fear Dot Com is more frustrating than a modem that disconnects every 10 seconds .
1141	negative	The documentary is much too conventional -- lots of boring talking heads , etc. -- to do the subject matter justice .
5004	positive	A witty , low-key romantic comedy .
3781	positive	Gay or straight , Kissing Jessica Stein is one of the greatest date movies in years .
4141	negative	I ca n't say this enough : This movie is about an adult male dressed in pink jammies .
1347	positive	While the humor is recognizably Plympton , he has actually bothered to construct a real story this time .
2501	positive	The Four Feathers is definitely horse feathers , but if you go in knowing that , you might have fun in this cinematic sandbox .
6253	neutral	Egoyan 's work often elegantly considers various levels of reality and uses shifting points of view , but here he has constructed a film so labyrinthine that it defeats his larger purpose .
8368	negative	Just a collection of this and that -- whatever fills time -- with no unified whole .
953	neutral	The respective charms of Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant have worn threadbare .
4401	positive	out ballsy and stylish
303	positive	Beating the Austin Powers films at their own game , this blaxploitation spoof downplays the raunch in favor of gags that rely on the strength of their own cleverness as opposed to the extent of their outrageousness .
7253	negative	The problem with movies about angels is they have a tendency to slip into hokum .
5603	positive	A colorful , joyous celebration of life ; a tapestry woven of romance , dancing , singing , and unforgettable characters .
7155	negative	Instead of making his own style , director Marcus Adams just copies from various sources -- good sources , bad mixture
7369	positive	It 's sweet , funny , charming , and completely delightful .
3306	negative	the film never rises above a conventional , two dimension tale
6950	negative	What 's hard to understand is why anybody picked it up .
2965	negative	Despite terrific special effects and funnier gags , Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets finds a way to make J.K. Rowling 's marvelous series into a deadly bore .
6513	negative	But the film itself is ultimately quite unengaging .
430	negative	In one scene , we get a stab at soccer hooliganism , a double-barreled rip-off of Quentin Tarantino 's climactic shootout -- and Meat Loaf explodes .
679	neutral	This is not Chabrol 's best , but even his lesser works outshine the best some directors can offer .
7617	positive	It 's all stitched together with energy , intelligence and verve , enhanced by a surplus of vintage archive footage .
6937	positive	For the most part , it works beautifully as a movie without sacrificing the integrity of the opera .
6905	negative	The Hanukkah spirit seems fried in pork .
742	negative	Vaguely interesting , but it 's just too too much .
3277	negative	Like Mike is a slight and uninventive movie : Like the exalted Michael Jordan referred to in the title , many can aspire but none can equal .
6476	negative	The sort of picture in which , whenever one of the characters has some serious soul searching to do , they go to a picture-perfect beach during sunset .
2422	positive	Koury frighteningly and honestly exposes one teenager 's uncomfortable class resentment and , in turn , his self-inflicted retaliation .
7856	negative	With a tone as variable as the cinematography , Schaeffer 's film never settles into the light-footed enchantment the material needs , and the characters ' quirks and foibles never jell into charm .
2592	positive	I have n't laughed that hard in years !
7733	neutral	An extraordinarily silly thriller .
4800	positive	Rife with the rueful , wry humor springing out of Yiddish culture and language .

5843	negative	The Master of Disguise falls under the category of ` should have been a sketch on Saturday Night Live . '
3784	positive	I encourage young and old alike to go see this unique and entertaining twist on the classic whale 's tale -- you wo n't be sorry !
3141	negative	The setting turns out to be more interesting than any of the character dramas , which never reach satisfying conclusions .
486	negative	... in the pile of useless actioners from MTV schmucks who do n't know how to tell a story for more than four minutes .
1229	neutral	This heist flick about young Brooklyn hoods is off the shelf after two years to capitalize on the popularity of Vin Diesel , Seth Green and Barry Pepper .
6997	positive	Never Again , while nothing special , is pleasant , diverting and modest -- definitely a step in the right direction .
5354	negative	The problem with the mayhem in Formula 51 is not that it 's offensive , but that it 's boring .
2468	neutral	Sometimes shorter is better .
2856	neutral	True Hollywood Story .
8129	negative	Mr. Soderbergh 's direction and visual style struck me as unusually and unimpressively fussy and pretentious .
4735	negative	Barney 's ideas about creation and identity do n't really seem all that profound , at least by way of what can be gleaned from this three-hour endurance test built around an hour 's worth of actual material .
5196	neutral	`` It 's all about the image . ''
7389	positive	An amusing and unexpectedly insightful examination of sexual jealousy , resentment and the fine line between passion and pretence .

7570	negative	Things really get weird , though not particularly scary : the movie is all portent and no content .
4515	positive	A weird and wonderful comedy .
3715	neutral	What started out as a taut contest of wills between Bacon and Theron , deteriorates into a protracted and borderline silly chase sequence .

226	negative	They threw loads of money at an idea that should 've been so much more even if it was only made for teenage boys and wrestling fans .
4675	positive	Kids should have a stirring time at this beautifully drawn movie .
6131	positive	Coppola 's directorial debut is an incredibly layered and stylistic film that , despite a fairly slow paced , almost humdrum approach to character development , still manages at least a decent attempt at meaningful cinema .
1167	positive	Director Tom Dey demonstrated a knack for mixing action and idiosyncratic humor in his charming 2000 debut Shanghai Noon , but Showtime 's uninspired send-up of TV cop show cliches mostly leaves him shooting blanks .

7883	positive	an admirable , sometimes exceptional film
1744	positive	For all the dolorous trim , Secretary is a genial romance that maintains a surprisingly buoyant tone throughout , notwithstanding some of the writers ' sporadic dips into pop Freudianism .
3169	negative	Sluggish , tonally uneven .

8271	neutral	If Jews were Catholics , this would be Catechism
13	positive	The performances are an absolute joy .
3090	positive	It 's a boring movie about a boring man , made watchable by a bravura performance from a consummate actor incapable of being boring .
4948	negative	Animated drivel meant to enhance the self-image of drooling idiots .
5079	positive	Nicks refuses to let Slackers be seen as just another teen movie , which means he can be forgiven for frequently pandering to fans of the gross-out comedy .
2801	negative	The high-concept scenario soon proves preposterous , the acting is robotically italicized , and truth-in-advertising hounds take note : There 's very little hustling on view .
258	positive	Genuinely unnerving .
1329	positive	It 's fun , but it 's a real howler .
2396	negative	Lookin ' for sin , American-style ?
6866	positive	Funny , somber , absurd , and , finally , achingly sad , Bartleby is a fine , understated piece of filmmaking .
7120	negative	Parts of the film feel a bit too much like an infomercial for Ram Dass 's latest book aimed at the boomer demographic .
8422	negative	The acting is n't much better .
6583	neutral	It 's difficult to discern if this is a crazy work of disturbed genius or merely 90 minutes of post-adolescent Electra rebellion .
2316	negative	The story is also as unoriginal as they come , already having been recycled more times than I 'd care to count .
2685	negative	The characters ... are paper-thin , and their personalities undergo radical changes when it suits the script .
116	neutral	But when it does , you 're entirely unprepared .
5892	neutral	You might say Tykwer has done all that Heaven allows , if you wanted to make as anti-Kieslowski a pun as possible .
5833	positive	Ramsay and Morton fill this character study with poetic force and buoyant feeling .
5686	negative	An incredibly narrow in-joke targeted to the tiniest segment of an already obscure demographic .
6416	negative	The movie itself appears to be running on hypertime in reverse as the truly funny bits get further and further apart .
2857	positive	The movie is amateurish , but it 's a minor treat .
1030	positive	`` Catch Me '' feels capable of charming the masses with star power , a pop-induced score and sentimental moments that have become a Spielberg trademark .
820	neutral	Curling may be a unique sport but Men with Brooms is distinctly ordinary .
21	positive	Best indie of the year , so far .
4482	positive	According to the script , Grant and Bullock 's characters are made for each other .
413	neutral	Bearable .
3541	positive	An enjoyable feel-good family comedy regardless of race .
5165	neutral	Maid in Manhattan might not look so appealing on third or fourth viewing down the road ... But as a high concept vehicle for two bright stars of the moment who can rise to fans ' lofty expectations , the movie passes inspection .
969	neutral	It pulls the rug out from under you , just when you 're ready to hate one character , or really sympathize with another character , something happens to send you off in different direction .
2075	positive	At its best , it 's Black Hawk Down with more heart .
5090	negative	Its plot and animation offer daytime TV serviceability , but little more .
4548	negative	Another useless recycling of a brutal mid - '70s American sports movie .
7620	positive	The acting , for the most part , is terrific , although the actors must struggle with the fact that they 're playing characters who sometimes feel more like literary conceits than flesh-and-blood humans .
6814	positive	What makes How I Killed My Father compelling , besides its terrific performances , is Fontaine 's willingness to wander into the dark areas of parent-child relationships without flinching .
5583	negative	A horror movie with seriously dumb characters , which somewhat dilutes the pleasure of watching them stalked by creepy-crawly bug things that live only in the darkness .
2529	negative	This strenuously unfunny Showtime deserves the hook .
5587	positive	Salma goes native and she 's never been better in this colorful bio-pic of a Mexican icon .
7356	positive	Woody Allen can write and deliver a one liner as well as anybody .
2450	positive	-LRB- The film -RRB- tackles the topic of relationships in such a straightforward , emotionally honest manner that by the end , it 's impossible to ascertain whether the film is , at its core , deeply pessimistic or quietly hopeful .
5170	neutral	Sometimes this modest little number clicks , and sometimes it does n't .
2044	positive	An intriguing look at the French film industry during the German occupation ; its most delightful moments come when various characters express their quirky inner selves .
655	negative	The only surprise is that heavyweights Joel Silver and Robert Zemeckis agreed to produce this ; I assume the director has pictures of them cavorting in ladies ' underwear .
7546	positive	It is OK for a movie to be something of a sitcom apparatus , if the lines work , the humor has point and the actors are humanly engaged .
4426	neutral	The obligatory break-ups and hook-ups do n't seem to have much emotional impact on the characters .
459	negative	Too long , and larded with exposition , this somber cop drama ultimately feels as flat as the scruffy sands of its titular community .
2339	positive	If you can get past the taboo subject matter , it will be well worth your time .
6520	negative	The criticism never rises above easy , cynical potshots at morally bankrupt characters ...
2645	negative	The movie attempts to mine laughs from a genre -- the gangster\/crime comedy -- that wore out its welcome with audiences several years ago , and its cutesy reliance on movie-specific cliches is n't exactly endearing .
287	negative	-LRB- A -RRB- rather thinly-conceived movie .
274	neutral	Screenwriter Chris ver Weil 's directing debut is good-natured and never dull , but its virtues are small and easily overshadowed by its predictability .
3017	positive	So beautifully acted and directed , it 's clear that Washington most certainly has a new career ahead of him if he so chooses .
1434	positive	The Pianist is the film Roman Polanski may have been born to make .
7664	negative	The holes in this film remain agape -- holes punched through by an inconsistent , meandering , and sometimes dry plot .
7058	negative	The Tuxedo miscalculates badly by forcing the star to play second fiddle to the dull effects that allow the suit to come to life .
2066	positive	A wild , endearing , masterful documentary .
1496	negative	Too intensely focused on the travails of being Hal Hartley to function as pastiche , No Such Thing is Hartley 's least accessible screed yet .
8058	neutral	So brisk is Wang 's pacing that none of the excellent cast are given air to breathe .
8191	negative	May offend viewers not amused by the sick sense of humor .
3701	positive	It 's a testament to the film 's considerable charm that it succeeds in entertaining , despite playing out like a feature-length sitcom replete with stereotypical familial quandaries .
1399	positive	I do n't feel the least bit ashamed in admitting that my enjoyment came at the expense of seeing justice served , even if it 's a dish that 's best served cold .
101	negative	-LRB- Green is -RRB- the comedy equivalent of Saddam Hussein , and I 'm just about ready to go to the U.N. and ask permission for a preemptive strike .
8029	positive	It works well enough , since the thrills pop up frequently , and the dispatching of the cast is as often imaginative as it is gory .
5753	negative	Yet another genre exercise , Gangster No. 1 is as generic as its title .
6026	negative	El Crimen Del Padre Amaro would likely be most effective if used as a tool to rally anti-Catholic protestors .
4720	positive	Confessions is n't always coherent , but it 's sharply comic and surprisingly touching , so hold the gong .
5295	negative	Seems content to dog-paddle in the mediocre end of the pool , and it 's a sad , sick sight .
5828	neutral	I 'm not generally a fan of vegetables but this batch is pretty cute .
6611	positive	Consummate actor Barry has done excellent work here .
1653	negative	It would be great to see this turd squashed under a truck , preferably a semi .
4368	positive	It is different from others in its genre in that it is does not rely on dumb gags , anatomical humor , or character cliches ; it primarily relies on character to tell its story .
1729	positive	At times a bit melodramatic and even a little dated -LRB- depending upon where you live -RRB- , Ignorant Fairies is still quite good-natured and not a bad way to spend an hour or two .
6761	positive	One feels the dimming of a certain ambition , but in its place a sweetness , clarity and emotional openness that recalls the classics of early Italian neorealism .
199	positive	This is a superior horror flick .
7367	neutral	Entertaining despite its one-joke premise with the thesis that women from Venus and men from Mars can indeed get together .
6289	positive	Puts to rest any thought that the German film industry can not make a delightful comedy centering on food .
3924	positive	Intensely romantic , thought-provoking and even an engaging mystery .
7362	neutral	Your nightmares , on the other hand , will be anything but .
4413	negative	It is parochial , accessible to a chosen few , standoffish to everyone else , and smugly suggests a superior moral tone is more important than filmmaking skill
6108	positive	This is Christmas Future for a lot of baby boomers .
987	negative	Bland but harmless .
2148	positive	The movie should jolt you out of your seat a couple of times , give you a few laughs , and leave you feeling like it was worth your seven bucks , even though it does turn out to be a bit of a cheat in the end .
7292	negative	But they lack their idol 's energy and passion for detail .
7709	negative	Piccoli 's performance is amazing , yes , but the symbols of loss and denial and life-at-arm 's - length in the film seem irritatingly transparent .
2583	neutral	Every child 's story is what matters .
5241	negative	Although the sequel has all the outward elements of the original , the first film 's lovely flakiness is gone , replaced by the forced funniness found in the dullest kiddie flicks .
941	positive	But it also has many of the things that made the first one charming .
6945	negative	Any reasonably creative eighth-grader could have written a more credible script , though with the same number of continuity errors .
8094	positive	Fred Schepisi 's tale of four Englishmen facing the prospect of their own mortality views youthful affluence not as a lost ideal but a starting point .
6526	negative	The innate theatrics that provide its thrills and extreme emotions lose their luster when flattened onscreen .
4568	negative	The trouble is , its filmmakers run out of clever ideas and visual gags about halfway through .
5999	negative	Devotees of Star Trek II : The Wrath of Khan will feel a nagging sense of deja vu , and the grandeur of the best Next Generation episodes is lacking .
5042	neutral	It follows the basic plot trajectory of nearly every Schwarzenegger film : Someone crosses Arnie .
7183	negative	The holiday message of the 37-minute Santa vs. the Snowman leaves a lot to be desired .
2864	negative	There 's more repetition than creativity throughout the movie .
8031	neutral	Norton holds the film together .
3445	neutral	Absolutely -LRB- and unintentionally -RRB- terrifying .

8397	negative	Let 's see , a haunted house , a haunted ship , what 's next ... Ghost Blimp ?
4129	neutral	A movie that at its best does n't just make the most out of its characters ' flaws but insists on the virtue of imperfection .
3179	positive	A fine , rousing , G-rated family film , aimed mainly at little kids but with plenty of entertainment value to keep grown-ups from squirming in their seats .
3954	neutral	The warnings to resist temptation in this film ... are blunt and challenging and offer no easy rewards for staying clean .
7525	negative	It 's tough to tell which is in more abundant supply in this woefully hackneyed movie , directed by Scott Kalvert , about street gangs and turf wars in 1958 Brooklyn -- stale cliches , gratuitous violence , or empty machismo .
1103	neutral	The wonderful combination of the sweetness and the extraordinary technical accomplishments of the first film are maintained , but its overall impact falls a little flat with a storyline that never quite delivers the original magic .
3155	negative	And neither do cliches , no matter how ` inside ' they are .
1548	negative	It 's simply stupid , irrelevant and deeply , truly , bottomlessly cynical .
3074	positive	A compelling motion picture that illustrates an American tragedy .
7791	negative	The film is grossly contradictory in conveying its social message , if indeed there is one .
635	positive	There has been a string of ensemble cast romances recently ... but Peter Mattei 's Love in the Time of Money sets itself apart by forming a chain of relationships that come full circle to end on a positive -LRB- if tragic -RRB- note .
5045	positive	There are so few films about the plight of American Indians in modern America that Skins comes as a welcome , if downbeat , missive from a forgotten front .
4094	negative	It 's coherent , well shot , and tartly acted , but it wears you down like a dinner guest showing off his doctorate .
5789	negative	Unfortunately , a cast of competent performers from movies , television and the theater are cast adrift in various New York City locations with no unifying rhythm or visual style .
2544	positive	Together , Miller , Kuras and the actresses make Personal Velocity into an intricate , intimate and intelligent journey .
3527	positive	... an eerily suspenseful , deeply absorbing piece that works as a treatise on spirituality as well as a solid sci-fi thriller .
7660	negative	Lucy 's a dull girl , that 's all .
1461	positive	This familiar rise-and-fall tale is long on glamour and short on larger moralistic consequences , though it 's told with sharp ears and eyes for the tenor of the times .
289	positive	Robinson 's web of suspense matches the page-turning frenzy that Clancy creates .
3564	neutral	has some visual wit ... but little imagination elsewhere .
8495	negative	Disgusting .
7885	positive	Well cast and well directed - a powerful drama with enough sardonic wit to keep it from being maudlin .
4565	positive	Both heartbreaking and heartwarming ... just a simple fable done in an artless sytle , but it 's tremendously moving .
1403	neutral	Ryosuke has created a wry , winning , if languidly paced , meditation on the meaning and value of family .
4931	negative	Until its final minutes this is a perceptive study of two families in crisis -- and of two girls whose friendship is severely tested by bad luck and their own immaturity .
1849	positive	Parents may even find that it goes by quickly , because it has some of the funniest jokes of any movie this year , including those intended for adults .
7970	negative	the film does n't sustain its initial promise with a jarring , new-agey tone creeping into the second half
911	negative	Consider the film a celluloid litmus test for the intellectual and emotional pedigree of your date and a giant step backward for a director I admire .
8208	negative	We 've liked Klein 's other work but Rollerball left us cold .
6027	neutral	... salaciously simplistic .
3876	positive	Escapes the precious trappings of most romantic comedies , infusing into the story very real , complicated emotions .
4215	neutral	If you already like this sort of thing , this is that sort of thing all over again .
296	neutral	The filmmakers might want to look it up .
8224	positive	An eloquent , reflective and beautifully acted meditation on both the profoundly devastating events of one year ago and the slow , painful healing process that has followed in their wake .
7181	neutral	Life or Something Like It has its share of high points , but it misses too many opportunities .
2072	negative	Appropriately cynical social commentary aside , # 9 never quite ignites .
2895	positive	Warm and exotic .
7217	neutral	The story , touching though it is , does not quite have enough emotional resonance or variety of incident to sustain a feature , and even at 85 minutes it feels a bit long .
2981	positive	Without resorting to camp or parody , Haynes -LRB- like Sirk , but differently -RRB- has transformed the rhetoric of Hollywood melodrama into something provocative , rich , and strange .
1666	neutral	Certainly .
6337	negative	Episode II -- Attack of the Clones is a technological exercise that lacks juice and delight .
5662	positive	Nicole Kidman makes it a party worth attending .

3681	positive	The ending feels at odds with the rest of the film .
1536	positive	The concert footage is stirring , the recording sessions are intriguing , and -- on the way to striking a blow for artistic integrity -- this quality band may pick up new admirers .
1082	negative	On its icy face , the new film is a subzero version of Monsters , Inc. , without the latter 's imagination , visual charm or texture .
8038	negative	It would n't matter so much that this arrogant Richard Pryor wannabe 's routine is offensive , puerile and unimaginatively foul-mouthed if it was at least funny .

8097	negative	A zippy 96 minutes of mediocre special effects , hoary dialogue , fluxing accents , and -- worst of all -- silly-looking Morlocks .
8134	positive	Upsetting and thought-provoking , the film has an odd purity that does n't bring you into the characters so much as it has you study them .
6911	neutral	In many ways , reminiscent of 1992 's Unforgiven which also utilized the scintillating force of its actors to draw out the menace of its sparse dialogue .

3677	positive	As much as I laughed throughout the movie , I can not mount a cogent defense of the film as entertainment , or even performance art , although the movie does leave you marveling at these guys ' superhuman capacity to withstand pain .

5866	negative	` In this poor remake of such a well loved classic , Parker exposes the limitations of his skill and the basic flaws in his vision . '
7741	negative	Director George Hickenlooper has had some success with documentaries , but here his sense of story and his juvenile camera movements smack of a film school undergrad , and his maudlin ending might not have gotten him into film school in the first place .

3853	positive	Together writer-director Danny Verete 's three tales comprise a powerful and reasonably fulfilling gestalt .
8089	positive	Inherently caustic and oddly whimsical , the film chimes in on the grieving process and strangely draws the audience into the unexplainable pain and eccentricities that are attached to the concept of loss .
2970	negative	A clumsily manufactured exploitation flick , a style-free exercise in manipulation and mayhem .
7986	positive	Director Charles Stone III applies more detail to the film 's music than to the story line ; what 's best about Drumline is its energy .

8111	positive	But that they are doing it is thought-provoking .
249	positive	It 's more enjoyable than I expected , though , and that 's because the laughs come from fairly basic comedic constructs .
2123	negative	The script is a tired one , with few moments of joy rising above the stale material .
3573	neutral	A movie that seems motivated more by a desire to match mortarboards with Dead Poets Society and Good Will Hunting than by its own story .

2658	negative	A sentimental mess that never rings true .
6323	negative	Throughout all the tumult , a question comes to mind : So why is this so boring ?
3708	negative	Stephen Earnhart 's documentary is a decomposition of healthy eccentric inspiration and ambition -- wearing a cloak of unsentimental , straightforward text -- when it 's really an exercise in gross romanticization of the delusional personality type .
976	negative	An EXIT sign , that is .
4186	negative	Qualities that were once amusing are becoming irritating .
4103	positive	Seen in that light , Moonlight Mile should strike a nerve in many .
8205	negative	The chocolate factory without Charlie .

5571	neutral	The climactic events are so well realized that you may forget all about the original conflict , just like the movie does
4644	neutral	Even though it is infused with the sensibility of a video director , it does n't make for completely empty entertainment
144	neutral	Initial strangeness inexorably gives way to rote sentimentality and mystical tenderness becomes narrative expedience .
5405	positive	A compelling yarn , but not quite a ripping one .
3171	positive	The story is a rather simplistic one : grief drives her , love drives him , and a second chance to find love in the most unlikely place - it struck a chord in me .
2227	positive	It 's fun , splashy and entertainingly nasty .
7580	negative	An ill-conceived jumble that 's not scary , not smart and not engaging .
7582	negative	Too bad none of it is funny .
2038	positive	This charming , thought-provoking New York fest of life and love has its rewards .
6890	neutral	When in doubt , the film ratchets up the stirring soundtrack , throws in a fish-out-of-water gag and lets the cliched dialogue rip .
4314	positive	Significantly better than its 2002 children 's - movie competition .
2921	positive	More than their unique residences , Home Movie is about the people who live in them , who have carved their own comfortable niche in the world and have been kind enough to share it .
4009	positive	Narc is a no-bull throwback to 1970s action films .
4411	neutral	Mandel Holland 's direction is uninspired , and his scripting unsurprising , but the performances by Phifer and Black are ultimately winning .
7642	negative	A 94-minute travesty of unparalleled proportions , writer-director Parker seems to go out of his way to turn the legendary wit 's classic mistaken identity farce into brutally labored and unfunny hokum .
4102	negative	The plot has a number of holes , and at times it 's simply baffling .
5488	negative	A ` Girls Gone Wild ' video for the boho art-house crowd , The Burning Sensation is n't a definitive counter-cultural document -- its makers are n't removed and inquisitive enough for that .
4737	positive	Even with all its botches , Enigma offers all the pleasure of a handsome and well-made entertainment .
7868	neutral	The most ill-conceived animated comedy since the 1991 dog Rover Dangerfield .

6891	negative	A movie that 's about as overbearing and over-the-top as the family it depicts .
2687	negative	Nothing more than four or five mild chuckles surrounded by 86 minutes of overly-familiar and poorly-constructed comedy .
4609	negative	The first mistake , I suspect , is casting Shatner as a legendary professor and Kunis as a brilliant college student -- where 's Pauly Shore as the rocket scientist ?
2545	positive	A very well-meaning movie , and it will stand in future years as an eloquent memorial to the World Trade Center tragedy .
1265	positive	A dazzling dream of a documentary .
3641	negative	About one in three gags in White 's intermittently wise script hits its mark ; the rest are padding unashamedly appropriated from the teen-exploitation playbook .
6089	positive	Some of the most inventive silliness you are likely to witness in a movie theatre for some time .
1671	positive	A fleet-footed and pleasingly upbeat family diversion .
6654	negative	An unholy mess , driven by the pathetic idea that if you shoot something on crummy-looking videotape , it must be labelled ` hip ' , ` innovative ' and ` realistic ' .
7020	neutral	Davis has energy , but she does n't bother to make her heroine 's book sound convincing , the gender-war ideas original , or the comic scenes fly .
6952	neutral	Its juxtaposition of overwrought existentialism and stomach-churning gore will have you forever on the verge of either cracking up or throwing up .
4903	negative	The things this movie tries to get the audience to buy just wo n't fly with most intelligent viewers .
6224	neutral	The most remarkable -LRB- and frustrating -RRB- thing about World Traveler , which opens today in Manhattan , is that its protagonist , after being an object of intense scrutiny for 104 minutes , remains a complete blank .
3298	negative	An awkwardly garish showcase that diverges from anything remotely probing or penetrating .
3972	neutral	`` Punch-Drunk Love '' is a little like a chocolate milk moustache ...
7837	positive	Weaver and LaPaglia are both excellent , in the kind of low-key way that allows us to forget that they are actually movie folk .
3307	negative	The audience when I saw this one was chuckling at all the wrong times , and that 's a bad sign when they 're supposed to be having a collective heart attack .
2538	neutral	The animation and backdrops are lush and inventive , yet Return to Neverland never manages to take us to that elusive , lovely place where we suspend our disbelief .
1928	negative	Needs more impressionistic cinematography and exhilarating point-of-view shots and fewer slow-motion ` grandeur ' shots and quick-cut edits that often detract from the athleticism .
526	negative	It 's about as convincing as any other Arnie musclefest , but has a little too much resonance with real world events and ultimately comes off as insultingly simplistic .
4484	neutral	The real question this movie poses is not ` Who ? '
1694	negative	The only thing scary about feardotcom is that the filmmakers and studio are brazen enough to attempt to pass this stinker off as a scary movie .
3652	positive	The most audacious , outrageous , sexually explicit , psychologically probing , pure libido film of the year has arrived from Portugal .
816	neutral	Did the film inform and educate me ?
392	positive	Much credit must be given to the water-camera operating team of Don King , Sonny Miller , and Michael Stewart .
4587	positive	With an unflappable air of decadent urbanity , Everett remains a perfect Wildean actor , and a relaxed Firth displays impeccable comic skill .
7130	positive	Watching the chemistry between Freeman and Judd , however , almost makes this movie worth seeing .
2080	positive	Far more successful , if considerably less ambitious , than last year 's Kubrick-meets-Spielberg exercise .
6657	negative	Cold , pretentious , thoroughly dislikable study in sociopathy .
8030	positive	The hard-to-predict and absolutely essential chemistry between the down-to-earth Bullock and the nonchalant Grant proves to be sensational , and everything meshes in this elegant entertainment .
6743	neutral	The pace and the visuals are so hyped up that a curious sense of menace informs everything .
2503	positive	Although it lacks the detail of the book , the film does pack some serious suspense .
3503	positive	Despite Besson 's high-profile name being Wasabi 's big selling point , there is no doubt that Krawczyk deserves a huge amount of the credit for the film 's thoroughly winning tone .
3597	neutral	While Howard 's appreciation of Brown and his writing is clearly well-meaning and sincere , the movie would be impossible to sit through were it not for the supporting cast .
948	positive	It 's a piece of handiwork that shows its indie tatters and self-conscious seams in places , but has some quietly moving moments and an intelligent subtlety .
993	negative	The script is a dim-witted pairing of teen-speak and animal gibberish .
6232	positive	It 's a compelling and horrifying story , and The Laramie Project is worthwhile for reminding us that this sort of thing does , in fact , still happen in America .
64	positive	The characters are more deeply thought through than in most ` right-thinking ' films .
5016	neutral	Bartlett 's hero remains a reactive cipher , when opening the man 's head and heart is the only imaginable reason for the film to be made .
2156	positive	A uniquely sensual metaphorical dramatization of sexual obsession that spends a bit too much time on its fairly ludicrous plot .
2312	negative	For this sort of thing to work , we need agile performers , but the proficient , dull Sorvino has no light touch , and Rodan is out of his league .
3716	positive	A fun family movie that 's suitable for all ages -- a movie that will make you laugh , cry and realize , ` It 's never too late to believe in your dreams . '
4299	negative	The movie 's blatant derivativeness is one reason it 's so lackluster .
2213	positive	Reggio and Glass put on an intoxicating show .
4500	positive	It 's incredible the number of stories the Holocaust has generated .
4117	positive	A poignant lyricism runs through Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress that transforms this story about love and culture into a cinematic poem .
611	positive	It 's as raw and action-packed an experience as a ringside seat at a tough-man contest .
2009	negative	Slack and uninspired , and peopled mainly by characters so unsympathetic that you 're left with a sour taste in your mouth .
6195	positive	The slam-bang superheroics are kinetic enough to engross even the most antsy youngsters .
5277	negative	Before it collapses into exactly the kind of buddy cop comedy it set out to lampoon , anyway .
4855	negative	his -LRB- Nelson 's -RRB- screenplay needs some serious re-working to show more of the dilemma , rather than have his characters stage shouting matches about it .
1110	negative	What ultimately makes Windtalkers a disappointment is the superficial way it deals with its story .
15	positive	I still like Moonlight Mile , better judgment be damned .
8394	positive	Audacious-impossible yet compelling ...
715	positive	No doubt the star and everyone else involved had their hearts in the right place .
7594	negative	How about surprising us by trying something new ?
2149	negative	You can fire a torpedo through some of Clancy 's holes , and the scripters do n't deserve any Oscars .
2463	negative	Like life on the island , the movie grows boring despite the scenery .
1063	negative	Crush could be the worst film a man has made about women since Valley of the Dolls .
7715	neutral	The 70-year-old Godard has become , to judge from In Praise of Love , the sort of bitter old crank who sits behind his light meter and harangues the supposed injustices of the artistic world-at-large without doing all that much to correct them .
2251	negative	Potty-mouthed enough for PG-13 , yet not as hilariously raunchy as South Park , this strangely schizo cartoon seems suited neither to kids or adults .
51	negative	Takes a clunky TV-movie approach to detailing a chapter in the life of the celebrated Irish playwright , poet and drinker .
4062	neutral	There are moments of real pleasure to be found in Sara Sugarman 's whimsical comedy Very Annie-Mary but not enough to sustain the film .
4453	positive	Malcolm McDowell is cool .
3634	negative	Most of the storylines feel like time fillers between surf shots .
2301	negative	There 's surely something wrong with a comedy where the only belly laughs come from the selection of outtakes tacked onto the end credits .
653	neutral	The beautiful , unusual music is this film 's chief draw , but its dreaminess may lull you to sleep .
5116	negative	Maybe LeBlanc thought , `` Hey , the movie about the baseball-playing monkey was worse . ''
1294	positive	Because the film deliberately lacks irony , it has a genuine dramatic impact ; it plays like a powerful 1957 drama we 've somehow never seen before .
6616	positive	E.T. works because its flabbergasting principals , 14-year-old Robert MacNaughton , 6-year-old Drew Barrymore and 10-year-old Henry Thomas , convince us of the existence of the wise , wizened visitor from a faraway planet .
4000	positive	This is a dark , gritty , sometimes funny little gem .
4764	neutral	Believes so fervently in humanity that it feels almost anachronistic , and it is too cute by half .
519	positive	A sexy , peculiar and always entertaining costume drama set in Renaissance Spain , and the fact that it 's based on true events somehow makes it all the more compelling .
6934	positive	If you 're not deeply touched by this movie , check your pulse .
3290	positive	Lee 's achievement extends to his supple understanding of the role that Brown played in American culture as an athlete , a movie star , and an image of black indomitability .
1689	positive	I 'm not a fan of the phrase ` life affirming ' because it usually means ` schmaltzy , ' but Real Women Have Curves truly is life affirming .
3359	positive	The gorgeously elaborate continuation of `` The Lord of the Rings '' trilogy is so huge that a column of words can not adequately describe co-writer\/director Peter Jackson 's expanded vision of J.R.R. Tolkien 's Middle-earth .
4645	neutral	Only in its final surprising shots does Rabbit-Proof Fence find the authority it 's looking for .
8123	negative	Too much of the movie feels contrived , as if the filmmakers were worried the story would n't work without all those gimmicks .
5307	positive	Offers a persuasive look at a defeated but defiant nation in flux .
6024	negative	This is the kind of movie during which you want to bang your head on the seat in front of you , at its cluelessness , at its idiocy , at its utterly misplaced earnestness .
803	positive	Has the capability of effecting change and inspiring hope .
350	neutral	When you resurrect a dead man , Hard Copy should come a-knocking , no ?
2793	positive	It 's a film that 's destined to win a wide summer audience through word-of-mouth reviews and , not far down the line , to find a place among the studio 's animated classics .
5189	negative	Disreputable doings and exquisite trappings are dampened by a lackluster script and substandard performances .
4924	negative	Those of you who are not an eighth grade girl will most likely doze off during this one .
6560	negative	The Good Girl is a film in which the talent is undeniable but the results are underwhelming .
1912	positive	At times , the movie looks genuinely pretty .
1241	positive	Maelstrom is strange and compelling , engrossing and different , a moral tale with a twisted sense of humor .
2430	neutral	`` Me Without You '' is a probing examination of a female friendship set against a few dynamic decades .
2818	negative	There is only so much baked cardboard I need to chew .
8478	negative	Lacks the visual flair and bouncing bravado that characterizes better hip-hop clips and is content to recycle images and characters that were already tired 10 years ago .

5326	positive	Much smarter and more attentive than it first sets out to be .
4182	neutral	But his showboating wise-cracker stock persona sure is getting old .
1494	positive	World Traveler might not go anywhere new , or arrive anyplace special , but it 's certainly an honest attempt to get at something .
2420	positive	That 's fun for kids of any age .
8053	positive	This masterfully calibrated psychological thriller thrives on its taut performances and creepy atmosphere even if the screenplay falls somewhat short .
56	positive	Both lead performances are Oscar-size .
1025	negative	It 's hard to believe that something so short could be so flabby .
8065	negative	On top of a foundering performance , -LRB- Madonna 's -RRB- denied her own athleticism by lighting that emphasizes every line and sag .
8460	negative	This pathetic junk is barely an hour long .
6369	positive	The film gets close to the chimps the same way Goodall did , with a serious minded patience , respect and affection .
2601	positive	Watching these two actors play against each other so intensely , but with restraint , is a treat .
1982	neutral	The pace of the film is very slow -LRB- for obvious reasons -RRB- and that too becomes off-putting .
8396	negative	Presents nothing special and , until the final act , nothing overtly disagreeable .
661	negative	Dong never pushes for insights beyond the superficial tensions of the dynamic he 's dissecting , and the film settles too easily along the contours of expectation .
3134	negative	It 's like an all-star salute to Disney 's cheesy commercialism .
2424	positive	An unorthodox little film noir organized crime story that includes one of the strangest love stories you will ever see .
6431	positive	Mel Gibson fights the good fight in Vietnam in director Randall Wallace 's flag-waving war flick with a core of decency .
127	positive	A thoughtful and surprisingly affecting portrait of a screwed-up man who dared to mess with some powerful people , seen through the eyes of the idealistic kid who chooses to champion his ultimately losing cause .
4733	negative	A retread of material already thoroughly plumbed by Martin Scorsese .
2443	negative	A grating , emaciated flick .
3962	negative	I walked away not really know who `` they '' were , what `` they '' looked like .
8472	negative	Even in terms of the low-grade cheese standards on which it operates , it never quite makes the grade as tawdry trash .

5632	neutral	Dull and mechanical , kinda like a very goofy museum exhibit
3407	negative	The Transporter bombards the viewer with so many explosions and side snap kicks that it ends up being surprisingly dull .
3691	negative	The pretensions -- and disposable story -- sink the movie .
5013	positive	It 's a treat -- a delightful , witty , improbable romantic comedy with a zippy jazzy score ... Grant and Bullock make it look as though they are having so much fun .
8451	negative	Weird .
8527	negative	Sometimes there are very , very good reasons for certain movies to be sealed in a jar and left on a remote shelf indefinitely .
4010	positive	Elegant and eloquent -LRB- meditation -RRB- on death and that most elusive of passions , love .
6045	neutral	Ozpetek joins the ranks of those gay filmmakers who have used the emigre experience to explore same-sex culture in ways that elude the more nationally settled .
255	positive	Offers the flash of rock videos fused with solid performances and eerie atmosphere .
6008	negative	One scene after another in this supposedly funny movie falls to the floor with a sickening thud .
2146	negative	It 's just a movie that happens to have Jackie Chan in it .
6753	negative	A distinctly minor effort that will be seen to better advantage on cable , especially considering its barely feature-length running time of one hour .
6399	positive	There 's a lot of tooth in Roger Dodger .
7492	neutral	Melodrama with a message .
6374	neutral	While Serving Sara does have a long way to go before it reaches the level of crudity in the latest Austin Powers extravaganza , there 's nothing here to match that movie 's intermittent moments of inspiration .
6985	negative	Unfortunately , Carvey 's rubber-face routine is no match for the insipid script he has crafted with Harris Goldberg .
12	negative	Kung Pow is Oedekerk 's realization of his childhood dream to be in a martial-arts flick , and proves that sometimes the dreams of youth should remain just that .
8536	negative	Simply put , there should have been a more compelling excuse to pair Susan Sarandon and Goldie Hawn .
7047	negative	A rather tired exercise in nostalgia .
252	negative	The only camouflage Carvey should now be considering is a paper bag to wear over his head when he goes out into public , to avoid being recognized as the man who bilked unsuspecting moviegoers .
2603	negative	Too infuriatingly quirky and taken with its own style .

6102	positive	Much of it comes from the brave , uninhibited performances by its lead actors .
5612	negative	What 's most offensive is n't the waste of a good cast , but the film 's denial of sincere grief and mourning in favor of bogus spiritualism .

2802	negative	Surprisingly , considering that Baird is a former film editor , the movie is rather choppy .

7757	positive	Not as good as The Full Monty , but a really strong second effort .
2336	negative	Like a bad improvisation exercise , the superficially written characters ramble on tediously about their lives , loves and the art they 're struggling to create .

1416	neutral	A perfectly acceptable , perfectly bland , competently acted but by no means scary horror movie .
6821	positive	While we no longer possess the lack-of-attention span that we did at seventeen , we had no trouble sitting for Blade II .

142	positive	-LRB- Cho 's face is -RRB- an amazing slapstick instrument , creating a scrapbook of living mug shots .
415	positive	But Kouyate elicits strong performances from his cast , and he delivers a powerful commentary on how governments lie , no matter who runs them .

8359	neutral	but ` Why ? '

5280	negative	Ultimately ... the movie is too heady for children , and too preachy for adults .

6587	positive	Earnest , unsubtle and Hollywood-predictable , Green Dragon is still a deeply moving effort to put a human face on the travail of thousands of Vietnamese .
6755	negative	The acting is fine but the script is about as interesting as a recording of conversations at the Wal-Mart checkout line .
5155	positive	While obviously aimed at kids , The Country Bears ... should keep parents amused with its low groan-to-guffaw ratio .

2395	neutral	Witherspoon puts to rest her valley-girl image , but it 's Dench who really steals the show .
886	positive	Carrying off a spot-on Scottish burr , Duvall -LRB- also a producer -RRB- peels layers from this character that may well not have existed on paper .
636	positive	This is popcorn movie fun with equal doses of action , cheese , ham and cheek -LRB- as well as a serious debt to The Road Warrior -RRB- , but it feels like unrealized potential

6530	negative	An exercise in cynicism every bit as ugly as the shabby digital photography and muddy sound .
3930	neutral	This one is certainly well-meaning , but it 's also simple-minded and contrived .
4340	neutral	Even with Harris 's strong effort , the script gives him little to effectively probe Lear 's soul-stripping breakdown .
33	neutral	Ice Age is the first computer-generated feature cartoon to feel like other movies , and that makes for some glacial pacing early on .

341	negative	Sadly , ` Garth ' has n't progressed as nicely as ` Wayne . '

4806	positive	Michael Moore 's latest documentary about America 's thirst for violence is his best film yet ...

7458	positive	Still rapturous after all these years , Cinema Paradiso stands as one of the great films about movie love .
3076	negative	Much like its easily dismissive take on the upscale lifestyle , there is n't much there here .
3645	positive	`` Brown Sugar '' admirably aspires to be more than another `` Best Man '' clone by weaving a theme throughout this funny film .
7577	positive	What saves this deeply affecting film from being merely a collection of wrenching cases is Corcuera 's attention to detail .
3450	negative	One of the most depressing movie-going experiences I can think of is to sit through about 90 minutes of a so-called ` comedy ' and not laugh once .
528	positive	In between the icy stunts , the actors spout hilarious dialogue about following your dream and ` just letting the mountain tell you what to do . '
2751	positive	A disoriented but occasionally disarming saga packed with moments out of an Alice in Wonderland adventure , a stalker thriller , and a condensed season of TV 's Big Brother .
7090	positive	A few nonbelievers may rethink their attitudes when they see the joy the characters take in this creed , but skeptics are n't likely to enter the theater .
7954	neutral	Unofficially , National Lampoon 's Van Wilder is Son of Animal House .
739	negative	In theory , a middle-aged romance pairing Clayburgh and Tambor sounds promising , but in practice it 's something else altogether -- clownish and offensive and nothing at all like real life .
1238	positive	-LRB- It 's -RRB- a clever thriller with enough unexpected twists to keep our interest .
6264	positive	Raimi and his team could n't have done any better in bringing the story of Spider-Man to the big screen .
2566	negative	Frankly , it 's kind of insulting , both to men and women .
8389	negative	Some fine acting , but ultimately a movie with no reason for being .
2701	neutral	Unspools like a highbrow , low-key , 102-minute infomercial , blending entrepreneurial zeal with the testimony of satisfied customers .
7671	positive	Even if Invincible is not quite the career peak that The Pianist is for Roman Polanski , it demonstrates that Werner Herzog can still leave us with a sense of wonder at the diverse , marvelously twisted shapes history has taken .
2267	positive	Muccino seems to be exploring the idea of why human beings long for what they do n't have , and how this gets us in trouble .

4592	negative	Too bad Maggio could n't come up with a better script .
2127	positive	Infidelity drama is nicely shot , well-edited and features a standout performance by Diane Lane .
6331	negative	If Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood suffers from a ploddingly melodramatic structure , it comes to life in the performances .
325	positive	See it .
3770	positive	Hardly an objective documentary , but it 's great cinematic polemic ... love Moore or loathe him , you 've got to admire ... the intensity with which he 's willing to express his convictions .

5615	positive	Directed by Kevin Bray , whose crisp framing , edgy camera work , and wholesale ineptitude with acting , tone and pace very obviously mark him as a video helmer making his feature debut .
641	negative	or maybe `` How will you feel after an 88-minute rip-off of The Rock with action confined to slo-mo gun firing and random glass-shattering ? ''
2512	positive	S1M0NE 's satire is not subtle , but it is effective .
3858	negative	I could have used my two hours better watching Being John Malkovich again .
3911	negative	As a director , Eastwood is off his game -- there 's no real sense of suspense , and none of the plot ` surprises ' are really surprising .

2720	positive	A solidly constructed , entertaining thriller that stops short of true inspiration .

4053	neutral	So riddled with unanswered questions that it requires gargantuan leaps of faith just to watch it plod along .
1360	negative	After several scenes of this tacky nonsense , you 'll be wistful for the testosterone-charged wizardry of Jerry Bruckheimer productions , especially because Half Past Dead is like The Rock on a Wal-Mart budget .
3841	positive	When you 've got the wildly popular Vin Diesel in the equation , it adds up to big box office bucks all but guaranteed .
5104	neutral	Are monsters born , or made ?
3547	negative	Both shrill and soporific , and because everything is repeated five or six times , it can seem tiresomely simpleminded .
5000	negative	It 's as sorry a mess as its director 's diabolical debut , Mad Cows .

5419	positive	Your children will be occupied for 72 minutes .
2872	positive	The film is old-fashioned , occasionally charming and as subtle as boldface .
6643	positive	A highly spirited , imaginative kid 's movie that broaches neo-Augustinian theology : Is God stuck in Heaven because He 's afraid of His best-known creation ?
3984	negative	Has none of the crackle of `` Fatal Attraction '' , `` 9 1\/2 Weeks '' , or even `` Indecent Proposal '' , and feels more like Lyne 's stolid remake of `` Lolita '' .
3856	negative	-LRB- Denis ' -RRB- bare-bones narrative more closely resembles an outline for a '70s exploitation picture than the finished product .
1959	neutral	Ruh-roh !
3151	positive	Exciting documentary .

593	negative	Overly long and worshipful bio-doc .

6848	neutral	Malone does have a gift for generating nightmarish images that will be hard to burn out of your brain .
3008	negative	As a story of dramatic enlightenment , the screenplay by Billy Ray and Terry George leaves something to be desired .

2205	positive	A charming , banter-filled comedy ... one of those airy cinematic bon bons whose aims -- and by extension , accomplishments -- seem deceptively slight on the surface .

887	neutral	A solid piece of journalistic work that draws a picture of a man for whom political expedience became a deadly foreign policy .
6877	positive	Even when it drags , we are forced to reflect that its visual imagination is breathtaking
6483	neutral	Disappointingly , the characters are too strange and dysfunctional , Tom included , to ever get under the skin , but this is compensated in large part by the off-the-wall dialogue , visual playfulness and the outlandishness of the idea itself .

4294	neutral	The fourth in a series that I 'll bet most parents had thought -- hoped !

6348	positive	A miraculous movie , I 'm Going Home is so slight , yet overflows with wisdom and emotion .
5696	negative	I have to admit that I am baffled by Jason X.
1900	neutral	Secretary is not a movie about fetishism .
5982	positive	This new movie version of the Alexandre Dumas classic is the stuff of high romance , brought off with considerable wit .
8092	positive	With an expressive face reminiscent of Gong Li and a vivid personality like Zhang Ziyi 's , Dong stakes out the emotional heart of Happy .
109	positive	Filmmaker Tian Zhuangzhuang triumphantly returns to narrative filmmaking with a visually masterful work of quiet power .
7279	positive	What 's so striking about Jolie 's performance is that she never lets her character become a caricature -- not even with that radioactive hair .
5157	negative	Most fish stories are a little peculiar , but this is one that should be thrown back in the river .
7912	positive	This movie has the usual impossible stunts ... But it has just as many scenes that are lean and tough enough to fit in any modern action movie .
1724	negative	Though there are entertaining and audacious moments , the movie 's wildly careening tone and an extremely flat lead performance do little to salvage this filmmaker 's flailing reputation .
2700	positive	A well-crafted film that is all the more remarkable because it achieves its emotional power and moments of revelation with restraint and a delicate ambiguity .
7432	negative	Yet another Arnold vehicle that fails to make adequate use of his particular talents .
8254	positive	Congrats Disney on a job well done , I enjoyed it just as much !
5712	neutral	Feels as if the inmates have actually taken over the asylum .
770	negative	A generic international version of a typical American horror film .
5998	negative	... a complete shambles of a movie so sloppy , so uneven , so damn unpleasant that I ca n't believe any viewer , young or old , would have a good time here .
7914	negative	It 's a drag how Nettelbeck sees working women -- or at least this working woman -- for whom she shows little understanding .
8353	neutral	Meandering and glacially paced , and often just plain dull .
8338	neutral	The movie should be credited with remembering his victims .
7917	neutral	`` 13 Conversations '' holds its goodwill close , but is relatively slow to come to the point .
1977	positive	Manages to be wholesome and subversive at the same time .
1865	positive	The rich performances by Friel -- and especially Williams , an American actress who becomes fully English -- round out the square edges .
682	negative	The movie is undone by a filmmaking methodology that 's just experimental enough to alienate the mainstream audience while ringing cliched to hardened indie-heads .
362	negative	An unsophisticated sci-fi drama that takes itself all too seriously .
1361	negative	Could n't someone take Rob Schneider and have him switch bodies with a funny person ?
7041	negative	Rife with nutty cliches and far too much dialogue .
2419	neutral	A very familiar tale , one that 's been told by countless filmmakers about Italian - , Chinese - , Irish - , Latin - , Indian - , Russian - and other hyphenate American young men struggling to balance conflicting cultural messages .
8203	positive	Together -LRB- Time Out and Human Resources -RRB- establish Mr. Cantet as France 's foremost cinematic poet of the workplace .
8230	negative	Forget the misleading title , what 's with the unexplained baboon cameo ?
4607	positive	Maryam is a small film , but it offers large rewards .
407	neutral	An ambitious , serious film that manages to do virtually everything wrong ; sitting through it is something akin to an act of cinematic penance .
4359	neutral	Eccentric enough to stave off doldrums , Caruso 's self-conscious debut is also eminently forgettable .
2660	positive	For those of an indulgent , slightly sunbaked and summery mind , Sex and Lucia may well prove diverting enough .
1079	negative	Ultimately , in the history of the Academy , people may be wondering what all that jazz was about `` Chicago '' in 2002 .
6540	positive	The powder blues and sun-splashed whites of Tunis make an alluring backdrop for this sensuous and spirited tale of a prim widow who finds an unlikely release in belly-dancing clubs .
1427	negative	Puportedly `` Based on True Events , '' a convolution of language that suggests it 's impossible to claim that it is `` Based on a True Story '' with a straight face .
2098	negative	Too slow for a younger crowd , too shallow for an older one .
1206	positive	The cast is spot on and the mood is laid back .
7067	positive	There 's absolutely no reason why Blue Crush , a late-summer surfer girl entry , should be as entertaining as it is
8494	positive	We admire this film for its harsh objectivity and refusal to seek our tears , our sympathies .
4048	negative	... feels as if -LRB- there 's -RRB- a choke leash around your neck so director Nick Cassavetes can give it a good , hard yank whenever he wants you to feel something .
6212	neutral	Just how these families interact may surprise you .
2629	negative	-LRB- Davis -RRB- wants to cause his audience an epiphany , yet he refuses to give us real situations and characters .
4562	neutral	I did n't think so .
6955	negative	The problematic characters and overly convenient plot twists foul up Shum 's good intentions .
6392	negative	Wewannour money back , actually .
2150	negative	A non-Britney person might survive a screening with little harm done , except maybe for the last 15 minutes , which are as maudlin as any after-school special you can imagine .
3246	neutral	-LRB- Screenwriter -RRB- Pimental took the Farrelly Brothers comedy and feminized it , but it is a rather poor imitation .
7995	negative	The film 's trailer also looked like crap , so crap is what I was expecting .
7355	positive	It is hard not to be especially grateful for freedom after a film like this .
8055	neutral	`` Home Movie '' is the film equivalent of a lovingly rendered coffee table book .
275	negative	Too much of Storytelling moves away from Solondz 's social critique , casting its audience as that of intellectual lector in contemplation of the auteur 's professional injuries .
7801	positive	Does an impressive job of relating the complicated history of the war and of filling in the background .
157	positive	Has the rare capability to soothe and break your heart with a single stroke .
239	positive	Miyazaki is one of world cinema 's most wondrously gifted artists and storytellers .
2368	negative	Director Shekhar Kapur and screenwriters Michael Schiffer and Hossein Amini have tried hard to modernize and reconceptualize things , but the barriers finally prove to be too great .
3644	neutral	Made me feel uneasy , even queasy , because -LRB- Solondz 's -RRB- cool compassion is on the border of bemused contempt .
3679	positive	Engages us in constant fits of laughter , until we find ourselves surprised at how much we care about the story , and end up walking out not only satisfied but also somewhat touched .
5006	negative	Death might be a release .
6223	positive	Despite its faults , Gangs excels in spectacle and pacing .
4363	positive	It 's funny , touching , dramatically forceful , and beautifully shot .
711	positive	I 'd watch these two together again in a New York minute .
7259	negative	As saccharine movies go , this is likely to cause massive cardiac arrest if taken in large doses .
3174	negative	entertaining enough , but nothing new
652	positive	All three actresses are simply dazzling , particularly Balk , who 's finally been given a part worthy of her considerable talents .
3909	positive	I was impressed by how many tit-for-tat retaliatory responses the filmmakers allow before pulling the plug on the conspirators and averting an American-Russian Armageddon .
1664	positive	A good music documentary , probably one of the best since The Last Waltz .
1300	negative	This is cruel , misanthropic stuff with only weak claims to surrealism and black comedy .
7591	negative	The film has a kind of hard , cold effect .
2852	positive	A story about intelligent high school students that deals with first love sweetly but also seriously .
779	negative	Like a comedian who starts off promisingly but then proceeds to flop , Comedian runs out of steam after a half hour .
6441	positive	Nair 's attention to detail creates an impeccable sense of place , while Thurman and Lewis give what can easily be considered career-best performances .
1443	negative	A generic bloodbath that often becomes laughably unbearable when it is n't merely offensive .
7934	positive	A backstage must-see for true fans of comedy .
5514	negative	In the end , the movie bogs down in insignificance , saying nothing about Kennedy 's assassination and revealing nothing about the pathology it pretends to investigate .
1509	neutral	It seems Grant does n't need the floppy hair and the self-deprecating stammers after all .
1384	negative	A lot like the imaginary sport it projects onto the screen -- loud , violent and mindless .
1699	positive	The most brilliant and brutal UK crime film since Jack Carter went back to Newcastle , the first half of Gangster No. 1 drips with style and , at times , blood .
561	negative	As the movie dragged on , I thought I heard a mysterious voice , and felt myself powerfully drawn toward the light -- the light of the exit sign .
6788	neutral	Red Dragon is less baroque and showy than Hannibal , and less emotionally affecting than Silence .
7011	positive	The film has several strong performances .
6140	positive	Even though we know the outcome , the seesawing of the general 's fate in the arguments of competing lawyers has the stomach-knotting suspense of a legal thriller , while the testimony of witnesses lends the film a resonant undertone of tragedy .
7813	negative	A feel-good movie that does n't give you enough to feel good about .
944	positive	But never mind all that ; the boobs are fantasti
6639	neutral	Dong shows how intolerance has the power to deform families , then tear them apart .
668	neutral	If A Few Good Men told us that we `` ca n't handle the truth '' than High Crimes poetically states at one point in this movie that we `` do n't care about the truth . ''
8306	negative	The sheer dumbness of the plot -LRB- other than its one good idea -RRB- and the movie 's inescapable air of sleaziness get you down .
4564	negative	And in a sense , that 's a liability .
7471	positive	Cuaron repeatedly , perversely undercuts the joie de vivre even as he creates it , giving the movie a mournful undercurrent that places the good-time shenanigans in welcome perspective .
2792	positive	She is a lioness , protecting her cub , and he a reluctant villain , incapable of controlling his crew .
5668	positive	Adaptation is intricately constructed and in a strange way nails all of Orlean 's themes without being a true adaptation of her book .
8152	positive	Even through its flaws , Revolution # 9 proves to be a compelling , interestingly told film .
964	positive	This one is not nearly as dreadful as expected .
558	negative	It all comes down to whether you can tolerate Leon Barlow .
6080	neutral	Jarecki and Gibney do find enough material to bring Kissinger 's record into question and explain how the diplomat 's tweaked version of statecraft may have cost thousands and possibly millions of lives .
4796	neutral	Bad in such a bizarre way that it 's almost worth seeing , if only to witness the crazy confluence of purpose and taste .
6739	positive	With ` Bowling for Columbine , ' Michael Moore gives us the perfect starting point for a national conversation about guns , violence , and fear .
7344	positive	Beautifully crafted and cooly unsettling ... recreates the atmosphere of the crime expertly .
7737	positive	An ingenious and often harrowing look at damaged people and how families can offer either despair or consolation .
25	neutral	The plot is romantic comedy boilerplate from start to finish .
7446	negative	Shame on writer\/director Vicente Aranda for making a florid biopic about mad queens , obsessive relationships , and rampant adultery so dull .
7182	positive	Piercingly affecting ... while clearly a manipulative film , emerges as powerful rather than cloying .
7996	neutral	The biggest problem with this movie is that it 's not nearly long enough .
5053	neutral	Like being invited to a classy dinner soiree and not knowing anyone .
6883	positive	It 's consistently funny , in an irresistible junior-high way , and consistently free of any gag that would force you to give it a millisecond of thought .
4031	neutral	This film was made by and for those folks who collect the serial killer cards and are fascinated by the mere suggestion of serial killers .
5945	negative	The nicest thing that can be said about Stealing Harvard -LRB- which might have been called Freddy Gets Molested by a Dog -RRB- is that it 's not as obnoxious as Tom Green 's Freddie Got Fingered .
1758	positive	Like all great films about a life you never knew existed , it offers much to absorb and even more to think about after the final frame .
5376	negative	... familiar and predictable , and 4\/5ths of it might as well have come from a Xerox machine rather than -LRB- writer-director -RRB- Franc .
5765	negative	The inherent limitations of using a video game as the source material movie are once again made all too clear in this schlocky horror\/action hybrid .
1843	negative	What could have been right at home as a nifty plot line in Steven Soderbergh 's Traffic fails to arrive at any satisfying destination .
6622	negative	Painfully padded .
2631	negative	Rashomon-for-dipsticks tale .
7284	negative	It 's as if Solondz had two ideas for two movies , could n't really figure out how to flesh either out , so he just slopped ` em together here .
1354	neutral	Though it inspires some -LRB- out-of-field -RRB- creative thought , the film is -- to its own detriment -- much more a cinematic collage than a polemical tract .
7605	negative	Then again , in a better movie , you might not have noticed .
8456	positive	The kind of sweet-and-sour insider movie that film buffs will eat up like so much gelati .
5901	neutral	Far away .
1477	negative	With little visible talent and no energy , Colin Hanks is in bad need of major acting lessons and maybe a little coffee .
3026	positive	a delightful romantic comedy with plenty of bite .
5584	negative	... plays like a badly edited , 91-minute trailer -LRB- and -RRB- the director ca n't seem to get a coherent rhythm going .
5987	negative	There 's not a single jump-in-your-seat moment and believe it or not , Jason actually takes a backseat in his own film to special effects .
4125	negative	In that setting , their struggle is simply too ludicrous and borderline insulting .
7987	positive	If you can read the subtitles -LRB- the opera is sung in Italian -RRB- and you like ` Masterpiece Theatre ' type costumes , you 'll enjoy this movie .
212	negative	Parents beware ; this is downright movie penance .
263	positive	Witty and often surprising , a dark little morality tale disguised as a romantic comedy .
1321	neutral	If only there were one for this kind of movie .
3042	neutral	The sound of GUNFIRE and cell phones RINGING .
1178	positive	Amazing !
4871	negative	An affable but undernourished romantic comedy that fails to match the freshness of the actress-producer and writer 's previous collaboration , Miss Congeniality .
1673	neutral	This follow-up seems so similar to the 1953 Disney classic that it makes one long for a geriatric Peter .
8259	neutral	... would be a total loss if not for two supporting performances taking place at the movie 's edges .
8433	negative	A markedly inactive film , City is conversational bordering on confessional .
2308	positive	A generous , inspiring film that unfolds with grace and humor and gradually becomes a testament to faith .
1750	positive	But while the highly predictable narrative falls short , Treasure Planet is truly gorgeous to behold .
1258	negative	You might want to take a reality check before you pay the full ticket price to see `` Simone , '' and consider a DVD rental instead .
2998	positive	What makes the film special is the refreshingly unhibited enthusiasm that the people , in spite of clearly evident poverty and hardship , bring to their music .
2471	positive	It 's a great American adventure and a wonderful film to bring to IMAX .
5135	positive	This is a nicely handled affair , a film about human darkness but etched with a light -LRB- yet unsentimental -RRB- touch .
1545	negative	But it 's hard to imagine a more generic effort in the genre .
1396	positive	The movie does its best to work us over , with second helpings of love , romance , tragedy , false dawns , real dawns , comic relief , two separate crises during marriage ceremonies , and the lush scenery of the Cotswolds .
5690	positive	In painting an unabashedly romantic picture of a nation whose songs spring directly from the lives of the people , the movie exalts the Marxian dream of honest working folk , with little to show for their labor , living harmoniously , joined in song .
1594	neutral	What you end up getting is the Vertical Limit of surfing movies - memorable stunts with lots of downtime in between .
2453	negative	What 's infuriating about Full Frontal is that it 's too close to real life to make sense .
5394	positive	At its most basic , this cartoon adventure is that wind-in-the-hair exhilarating .
1799	negative	Though Harris is affecting at times , he can not overcome the sense that Pumpkin is a mere plot pawn for two directors with far less endearing disabilities .
1356	positive	Does a good job of establishing a time and place , and of telling a fascinating character 's story .
3375	neutral	Gives us a lot to chew on , but not all of it has been properly digested .
2722	negative	I 'm not sure which will take longer to heal : the welt on Johnny Knoxville 's stomach from a riot-control projectile or my own tortured psyche .
883	neutral	You end up simply admiring this bit or that , this performance or that .
7561	positive	It 's no accident that The Accidental Spy is a solid action pic that returns the martial arts master to top form .
7227	negative	A Movie to Forget
1890	positive	The Wild Thornberrys Movie is pleasant enough and the message of our close ties with animals can certainly not be emphasized enough .
4195	positive	Strangely comes off as a kingdom more mild than wild .
5343	neutral	The camera whirls !
1913	neutral	Warmed-over hash .
4348	negative	Not good enough to pass for a litmus test of the generation gap and not bad enough to repulse any generation of its fans .
6068	negative	Narc is all menace and atmosphere .
2012	positive	For 95 often hilarious minutes
5610	positive	By halfway through this picture I was beginning to hate it , and , of course , feeling guilty for it ... Then , miracle of miracles , the movie does a flip-flop .
4006	negative	Think The Lion King redone for horses , with fewer deliberate laughs , more inadvertent ones and stunningly trite songs by Bryan Adams , the world 's most generic rock star .
6484	positive	See Scratch for the history , see Scratch for the music , see Scratch for a lesson in scratching , but , most of all , see it for the passion .
5424	positive	A thoroughly enjoyable , heartfelt coming-of-age comedy .
4339	positive	A gently funny , sweetly adventurous film that makes you feel genuinely good , that is to say , entirely unconned by false sentiment or sharp , overmanipulative Hollywood practices .
1589	neutral	Alain Choquart 's camera barely stops moving , portraying both the turmoil of the time and giving Conduct a perpetual sense of urgency , which , for a film that takes nearly three hours to unspool , is both funny and irritating .
7558	negative	The Rules of Attraction gets us too drunk on the party favors to sober us up with the transparent attempts at moralizing .
1109	negative	Those who are only mildly curious , I fear , will be put to sleep or bewildered by the artsy and often pointless visuals .
3367	neutral	Who is this movie for ?
7894	negative	Too bad Kramer could n't make a guest appearance to liven things up .
4723	positive	Terrific as Nadia , a Russian mail-order bride who comes to America speaking not a word of English , it 's Kidman who holds the film together with a supremely kittenish performance that gradually accumulates more layers .
8250	positive	As gory as the scenes of torture and self-mutilation may be , they are pitted against shimmering cinematography that lends the setting the ethereal beauty of an Asian landscape painting .
2490	positive	The best didacticism is one carried by a strong sense of humanism , and Bertrand Tavernier 's oft-brilliant Safe Conduct -LRB- `` Laissez-passer '' -RRB- wears its heart on its sleeve .
8162	positive	What makes it worth watching is Quaid 's performance .
5360	neutral	Anemic chronicle of money grubbing New Yorkers and their serial loveless hook ups .
3510	positive	Even better than the first one !
8437	positive	The result is somewhat satisfying -- it still comes from Spielberg , who has never made anything that was n't at least watchable .
4469	positive	The people in Jessica are so recognizable and true that , as in real life , we 're never sure how things will work out .
4783	negative	Never does `` Lilo & Stitch '' reach the emotion or timelessness of Disney 's great past , or even that of more recent successes such as `` Mulan '' or `` Tarzan . ''
506	neutral	Innocuous enough to make even Jean-Claude Van Damme look good .
2541	positive	A sensitive and astute first feature by Anne-Sophie Birot .
5639	positive	Brilliantly written and well-acted , Yellow Asphalt is an uncompromising film .
1234	positive	And it sees those relationships , including that between the son and his wife , and the wife and the father , and between the two brothers , with incredible subtlety and acumen .
3763	negative	Russell lacks the visual panache , the comic touch , and perhaps the budget of Sommers 's title-bout features .
