3811	negative	An admitted egomaniac , Evans is no Hollywood villain , and yet this grating showcase almost makes you wish he 'd gone the way of Don Simpson .
6072	neutral	Personal Velocity has a no-frills docu-Dogma plainness , yet Miller lingers on invisible , nearly psychic nuances , leaping into digressions of memory and desire .
3495	positive	Close enough in spirit to its freewheeling trash-cinema roots to be a breath of fresh air .
4185	negative	With nary a glimmer of self-knowledge , -LRB- Crane -RRB- becomes more specimen than character -- and Auto Focus remains a chilly , clinical lab report .
5576	negative	Coarse , cliched and clunky , this trifling romantic comedy in which opposites attract for no better reason than that the screenplay demands it squanders the charms of stars Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock .
3167	positive	It 's a square , sentimental drama that satisfies , as comfort food often can .
3845	negative	The whole talking-animal thing is grisly .
4560	positive	A lively and engaging examination of how similar obsessions can dominate a family .
5971	negative	The story really has no place to go since Simone is not real -- she ca n't provide any conflict .
1791	positive	While there are times when the film 's reach exceeds its grasp , the production works more often than it does n't .

8519	negative	With its parade of almost perpetually wasted characters ... Margarita feels like a hazy high that takes too long to shake .
2586	positive	A tone of rueful compassion ... reverberates throughout this film , whose meaning and impact is sadly heightened by current world events .
3885	positive	The wonder of Mostly Martha is the performance of Gedeck , who makes Martha enormously endearing .
5526	neutral	Impeccably filmed , sexually charged , but ultimately lacking in substance , not to mention dragged down by a leaden closing act .
3615	positive	Unexpected moments of authentically impulsive humor are the hallmark of this bittersweet , uncommonly sincere movie that portrays the frank humanity of ... emotional recovery .
1340	negative	Becomes the last thing you would expect from a film with this title or indeed from any Plympton film : boring .
1026	positive	Anyone who welcomes a dash of the avant-garde fused with their humor should take pleasure in this crazed , joyous romp of a film .
6356	negative	It 's supposed to be post-feminist breezy but ends up as tedious as the chatter of parrots raised on Oprah .
8079	negative	The acting is just fine , but there 's not enough substance here to sustain interest for the full 90 minutes , especially with the weak payoff .
6578	neutral	Everything is pegged into the groove of a New York dating comedy with ` issues ' to simplify .
2509	neutral	Feels slight , as if it were an extended short , albeit one made by the smartest kids in class .

1358	neutral	Spare yet audacious ...
4145	positive	If S&M seems like a strange route to true love , maybe it is , but it 's to this film 's -LRB- and its makers ' -RRB- credit that we believe that that 's exactly what these two people need to find each other -- and themselves .

6481	positive	An Asian neo-realist treasure .
3353	negative	Even if you 're an Elvis person , you wo n't find anything to get excited about on this DVD .
391	negative	Julie Davis is the Kathie Lee Gifford of film directors , sadly proving once again ego does n't always go hand in hand with talent .

6608	positive	It excels because , unlike so many other Hollywood movies of its ilk , it offers hope .
6376	negative	The story passes time until it 's time for an absurd finale of twisted metal , fireballs and revenge .
6047	negative	To better understand why this did n't connect with me would require another viewing , and I wo n't be sitting through this one again ... that in itself is commentary enough .

2071	positive	Executed with such gentle but insistent sincerity , with such good humor and appreciation of the daily grind that only the most hardhearted Scrooge could fail to respond .

4890	positive	The movie is ingenious fun .

4347	positive	My Big Fat Greek Wedding is that rare animal known as ' a perfect family film , ' because it 's about family .

854	neutral	A somewhat disappointing and meandering saga .
5288	positive	It 's a rare window on an artistic collaboration .
518	negative	I 'm not sure which is worse : the poor acting by the ensemble cast , the flat dialogue by Vincent R. Nebrida or the gutless direction by Laurice Guillen .
79	negative	This is a heartfelt story ... it just is n't a very involving one .
8277	negative	A pathetically inane and unimaginative cross between XXX and Vertical Limit .
5865	negative	A baffling subplot involving smuggling drugs inside Danish cows falls flat , and if you 're going to alter the Bard 's ending , you 'd better have a good alternative .
1720	negative	This tale has been told and retold ; the races and rackets change , but the song remains the same .
2682	neutral	A crisply made movie that is no more than mildly amusing .
624	positive	Like its parade of predecessors , this Halloween is a gory slash-fest .
5978	negative	But the feelings evoked in the film are lukewarm and quick to pass .
5735	positive	The Last Kiss will probably never achieve the popularity of My Big Fat Greek Wedding , but its provocative central wedding sequence has far more impact .

3827	negative	I think it was Plato who said , ' I think , therefore I know better than to rush to the theatre for this one . '

6962	positive	I know I should n't have laughed , but hey , those farts got to my inner nine-year-old .
507	negative	But if the essence of magic is its make-believe promise of life that soars above the material realm , this is the opposite of a truly magical movie .

5186	positive	A little uneven to be the cat 's meow , but it 's good enough to be the purr .
4065	positive	Spinning a web of dazzling entertainment may be overstating it , but `` Spider-Man '' certainly delivers the goods .
6326	positive	As animation increasingly emphasizes the computer and the cool , this is a film that takes a stand in favor of tradition and warmth .

6779	positive	The Pianist is Polanski 's best film .
5433	positive	The best film of the year 2002 .
5166	positive	Whether or not you buy Mr. Broomfield 's findings , the film acquires an undeniable entertainment value as the slight , pale Mr. Broomfield continues to force himself on people and into situations that would make lesser men run for cover .
1665	neutral	It is a movie about passion .
4789	positive	An impressive hybrid .
1947	positive	Poetic , heartbreaking .
7274	negative	The script becomes lifeless and falls apart like a cheap lawn chair .
1543	neutral	The main problem being that it 's only a peek .
4647	negative	While it 's all quite tasteful to look at , the attention process tends to do a little fleeing of its own .
1687	positive	Yet in its own aloof , unreachable way it 's so fascinating you wo n't be able to look away for a second .
8240	negative	The very simple story seems too simple and the working out of the plot almost arbitrary .
5905	negative	For a film about explosions and death and spies , `` Ballistic : Ecks vs. Sever '' seems as safe as a children 's film .
5541	neutral	Mildly entertaining .
3260	neutral	Brown 's saga , like many before his , makes for snappy prose but a stumblebum of a movie .
4893	positive	Melds derivative elements into something that is often quite rich and exciting , and always a beauty to behold .
4298	negative	Terminally bland , painfully slow and needlessly confusing ... The movie , shot on digital videotape rather than film , is frequently indecipherable .

4615	negative	It stars schticky Chris Rock and stolid Anthony Hopkins , who seem barely in the same movie .
6863	positive	Baby-faced Renner is eerily convincing as this bland blank of a man with unimaginable demons within .

8096	negative	Movies like High Crimes flog the dead horse of surprise as if it were an obligation .
6510	positive	The last scenes of the film are anguished , bitter and truthful .
7498	neutral	The director has injected self-consciousness into the proceedings at every turn .
7722	negative	Cox offers plenty of glimpses at existing photos , but there are no movies of Nijinsky , so instead the director treats us to an aimless hodgepodge .
520	positive	The Santa Clause 2 proves itself a more streamlined and thought out encounter than the original could ever have hoped to be .
7282	positive	The leanest and meanest of Solondz 's misanthropic comedies .
5418	positive	Schaeffer is n't in this film , which may be why it works as well as it does .
1997	positive	A lot smarter than your average Bond .

6744	negative	I 'm giving it thumbs down due to the endlessly repetitive scenes of embarrassment .
7280	negative	It 's supposed to be a romantic comedy - it suffers from too much Norma Rae and not enough Pretty Woman .

7460	positive	An enjoyable comedy
2244	positive	Maybe he was reading the minds of the audience .

5602	neutral	A perfectly respectable , perfectly inoffensive , easily forgettable film .
1346	negative	Full Frontal , which opens today nationwide , could almost be classified as a movie-industry satire , but it lacks the generous inclusiveness that is the genre 's definitive , if disingenuous , feature .
3815	positive	Definitely worth 95 minutes of your time .
1391	positive	One of the funniest motion pictures of the year , but ... also one of the most curiously depressing .
3272	positive	There are moments of hilarity to be had .
372	positive	`` Frailty '' offers chills much like those that you get when sitting around a campfire around midnight , telling creepy stories to give each other the willies .
8390	neutral	The movie has no respect for laws , political correctness or common decency , but it displays something more important : respect for its flawed , crazy people .
4678	negative	The movie is about as deep as that sentiment .
2287	neutral	... delivers few moments of inspiration amid the bland animation and simplistic story .
7781	positive	The spaniel-eyed Jean Reno infuses Hubert with a mixture of deadpan cool , wry humor and just the measure of tenderness required to give this comic slugfest some heart .
4610	positive	A faster paced family flick .
1298	positive	-LRB- A -RRB- real pleasure in its laid-back way .
666	negative	A sleek advert for youthful anomie that never quite equals the sum of its pretensions .

2724	negative	Too bad .
4020	negative	It 's been 13 months and 295 preview screenings since I last walked out on a movie , but Resident Evil really earned my indignant , preemptive departure .

4934	negative	but rather , ` How can you charge money for this ? '
5817	negative	It 's quite an achievement to set and shoot a movie at the Cannes Film Festival and yet fail to capture its visual appeal or its atmosphere .
5969	positive	It 's a satisfying summer blockbuster and worth a look .
2261	negative	It 's hard to imagine that even very small children will be impressed by this tired retread .
2418	negative	Well , this movie proves you wrong on both counts .
3775	negative	I suspect that you 'll be as bored watching Morvern Callar as the characters are in it .
6188	negative	-LRB- Lee -RRB- treats his audience the same way that Jim Brown treats his women -- as dumb , credulous , unassuming , subordinate subjects .
2414	positive	An engrossing story that combines psychological drama , sociological reflection , and high-octane thriller .
7016	positive	Judging by those standards , ` Scratch ' is a pretty decent little documentary .
2704	positive	The re-release of Ron Howard 's Apollo 13 in the IMAX format proves absolutely that really , really , really good things can come in enormous packages .
2723	negative	We do n't get paid enough to sit through crap like this .
3222	positive	It 's a very tasteful rock and roll movie .
2067	positive	Cool gadgets and creatures keep this fresh .
2311	neutral	When Seagal appeared in an orange prison jumpsuit , I wanted to stand up in the theater and shout , ` Hey , Kool-Aid ! '
553	positive	The color sense of Stuart Little 2 is its most immediate and most obvious pleasure , but it would count for very little if the movie were n't as beautifully shaped and as delicately calibrated in tone as it is .
3027	positive	It must be the end of the world : the best film so far this year is a franchise sequel starring Wesley Snipes .
2165	negative	For all the time we spend with these people , we never really get inside of them .
8043	positive	This is a fascinating film because there is no clear-cut hero and no all-out villain .
5192	neutral	Director Chris Eyre is going through the paces again with his usual high melodramatic style of filmmaking .
2653	negative	Despite its visual virtuosity , ` Naqoyqatsi ' is banal in its message and the choice of material to convey it .
450	neutral	What can one say about a balding 50-year-old actor playing an innocent boy carved from a log ?
3567	positive	Satisfyingly scarifying , fresh and old-fashioned at the same time .
4302	neutral	Directors Harry Gantz and Joe Gantz have chosen a fascinating subject matter , but the couples exposing themselves are n't all that interesting .

3150	negative	Did we really need a remake of `` Charade ? ''
8032	negative	There 's not one decent performance from the cast and not one clever line of dialogue .
4531	negative	Lacks the inspiration of the original and has a bloated plot that stretches the running time about 10 minutes past a child 's interest and an adult 's patience .
345	positive	The otherwise good-naturedness of Mr. Deeds , with its embrace of sheer goofiness and cameos of less - than-likely New York celebrities ... certainly raises the film above anything Sandler 's been attached to before .
1880	negative	Brosnan 's finest non-Bondish performance yet fails to overcome the film 's manipulative sentimentality and annoying stereotypes .
8118	neutral	Its strengths and weaknesses play off each other virtually to a stand-off , with the unfortunate trump card being the dreary mid-section of the film .
8	positive	The Importance of Being Earnest , so thick with wit it plays like a reading from Bartlett 's Familiar Quotations
7118	negative	A less-than-thrilling thriller .
424	positive	Any enjoyment will be hinge from a personal threshold of watching sad but endearing characters do extremely unconventional things .
2703	positive	Half Past Dead is just such an achievement .
2576	negative	I suspect that there are more interesting ways of dealing with the subject .

7105	positive	Wonder of wonders -- a teen movie with a humanistic message .
5836	neutral	To some eyes
4485	positive	It does give a taste of the Burning Man ethos , an appealing blend of counter-cultural idealism and hedonistic creativity .
3613	neutral	Some elements of it really blow the big one , but other parts are decent .
4804	negative	It 's horribly depressing and not very well done .
7964	negative	It 's as if Allen , at 66 , has stopped challenging himself .
7393	positive	Never once predictable .
2131	positive	Spielberg 's first real masterpiece , it deserved all the hearts it won -- and wins still , 20 years later .
5549	positive	Director Todd Solondz has made a movie about critical reaction to his two previous movies , and about his responsibility to the characters that he creates .
6406	positive	Often shocking but ultimately worthwhile exploration of motherhood and desperate mothers .
300	negative	Sadly , though many of the actors throw off a spark or two when they first appear , they ca n't generate enough heat in this cold vacuum of a comedy to start a reaction .
5086	positive	... certainly an entertaining ride , despite many talky , slow scenes .
3957	positive	Exactly what its title implies : lusty , boisterous and utterly charming .
4463	neutral	With miscast leads , banal dialogue and an absurdly overblown climax , Killing Me Softly belongs firmly in the so-bad-it 's - good camp .
8085	negative	What goes on for the 110 minutes of `` Panic Room '' is a battle of witlessness between a not-so-bright mother and daughter and an even less capable trio of criminals .
6656	neutral	The video work is so grainy and rough , so dependent on being ` naturalistic ' rather than carefully lit and set up , that it 's exhausting to watch .
6180	neutral	... generically , forgettably pleasant from start to finish .
2187	neutral	Like shave ice without the topping , this cinematic snow cone is as innocuous as it is flavorless .
5962	positive	An animation landmark as monumental as Disney 's 1937 breakthrough Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs .
7988	positive	`` Frailty '' starts out like a typical Bible killer story , but it turns out to be significantly different -LRB- and better -RRB- than most films with this theme .
7159	positive	It thankfully goes easy on the reel\/real world dichotomy that -LRB- Jaglom -RRB- pursued with such enervating determination in Venice\/Venice .
1014	neutral	Solondz creates some effective moments of discomfort for character and viewer alike .
7029	negative	What a stiflingly unfunny and unoriginal mess this is !
2624	positive	Director Carl Franklin , so crisp and economical in One False Move , bogs down in genre cliches here .
6274	neutral	The film makes strong arguments regarding the social status of America 's indigenous people , but really only exists to try to eke out an emotional tug of the heart , one which it fails to get .
7795	neutral	Sandra Bullock 's best dramatic performance to date -LRB- is -RRB- almost enough to lift -LRB- this -RRB- thrill-kill cat-and-mouser ... above its paint-by-numbers plot .
165	positive	Before it takes a sudden turn and devolves into a bizarre sort of romantic comedy , Steven Shainberg 's adaptation of Mary Gaitskill 's harrowing short story ... is a brilliantly played , deeply unsettling experience .
6136	negative	Sex ironically has little to do with the story , which becomes something about how lame it is to try and evade your responsibilities and that you should never , ever , leave a large dog alone with a toddler .
5377	positive	A movie just for Friday fans , critics be damned .
8234	negative	A frustrating ` tweener ' -- too slick , contrived and exploitative for the art houses and too cynical , small and decadent for the malls .
2307	positive	But it could be , by its art and heart , a necessary one .
667	negative	Statham employs an accent that I think is supposed to be an attempt at hardass American but sometimes just lapses into unhidden British .
8248	neutral	A typically observant , carefully nuanced and intimate French coming-of-age film that is an encouraging debut feature but has a needlessly downbeat ending that is too heavy for all that has preceded it .
4597	positive	Hashiguchi vividly captures the way young Japanese live now , chafing against their culture 's manic mix of millennial brusqueness and undying , traditional politesse .
3320	positive	A high-spirited buddy movie about the reunion of Berlin anarchists who face arrest 15 years after their crime .
23	negative	It 's like going to a house party and watching the host defend himself against a frothing ex-girlfriend .
2937	positive	Begins like a docu-drama but builds its multi-character story with a flourish .
2676	positive	It asks nothing of the audience other than to sit back and enjoy a couple of great actors hamming it up .
4331	negative	All the Queen 's Men is a throwback war movie that fails on so many levels , it should pay reparations to viewers .
1609	neutral	Watching Harris ham it up while physically and emotionally disintegrating over the course of the movie has a certain poignancy in light of his recent death , but Boyd 's film offers little else of consequence .
5160	negative	There 's no disguising this as one of the worst films of the summer .
3114	negative	Seagal ran out of movies years ago , and this is just the proof .

7797	negative	Soulless and -- even more damning -- virtually joyless , XXX achieves near virtuosity in its crapulence .
1716	positive	It 's good , hard-edged stuff , violent and a bit exploitative but also nicely done , morally alert and street-smart .
4176	positive	A portrait of hell so shattering it 's impossible to shake .
352	neutral	It 's hard to believe that a relationship like Holly and Marina 's could survive the hothouse emotions of teendom , and its longevity gets more inexplicable as the characterizations turn more crassly reductive .
4868	negative	While Scorsese 's bold images and generally smart casting ensure that `` Gangs '' is never lethargic , the movie is hindered by a central plot that 's peppered with false starts and populated by characters who are nearly impossible to care about .
521	negative	Goldmember has none of the visual wit of the previous pictures , and it looks as though Jay Roach directed the film from the back of a taxicab .

5503	neutral	For all the complications , it 's all surprisingly predictable .

5741	neutral	`` What really happened ? ''
5246	positive	A terrific insider look at the star-making machinery of tinseltown .
6820	negative	... instead go rent `` Shakes The Clown '' , a much funnier film with a similar theme and an equally great Robin Williams performance .

826	positive	A remarkably alluring film set in the constrictive Eisenhower era about one suburban woman 's yearning in the face of a loss that shatters her cheery and tranquil suburban life .
1155	negative	This slender plot feels especially thin stretched over the nearly 80-minute running time .
499	positive	Despite modest aspirations its occasional charms are not to be dismissed .
1631	neutral	It 's not the worst comedy of the year , but it certainly wo n't win any honors .
39	positive	Do n't judge this one too soon - it 's a dark , gritty story but it takes off in totally unexpected directions and keeps on going .
4937	negative	No one involved , save Dash , shows the slightest aptitude for acting , and the script , credited to director Abdul Malik Abbott and Ernest ` Tron ' Anderson , seems entirely improvised .

5091	negative	On the evidence before us , the answer is clear : Not easily and , in the end , not well enough .
6210	negative	As with so many merchandised-to-the-max movies of this type , more time appears to have gone into recruiting the right bands for the playlist and the costuming of the stars than into the script , which has a handful of smart jokes and not much else .
1830	neutral	Not to mention a sharper , cleaner camera lens .
760	positive	From a deceptively simple premise , this deeply moving French drama develops a startling story that works both as a detailed personal portrait and as a rather frightening examination of modern times .

3459	negative	Impostor is a step down for director Gary Fleder .
5319	negative	Debut effort by `` Project Greenlight '' winner is sappy and amateurish .
2250	negative	It shows that some studios firmly believe that people have lost the ability to think and will forgive any shoddy product as long as there 's a little girl-on-girl action .
3269	positive	Allen 's underestimated charm delivers more goodies than lumps of coal .
8532	negative	The film does n't really care about the thousands of Americans who die hideously , it cares about how Ryan meets his future wife and makes his start at the CIA .
5187	negative	Like its script , which nurses plot holes gaping enough to pilot an entire Olympic swim team through , the characters in Swimfan seem motivated by nothing short of dull , brain-deadening hangover .
798	negative	More of the same old garbage Hollywood has been trying to pass off as acceptable teen entertainment for some time now .
2215	negative	What with all the blanket statements and dime-store ruminations on vanity , the worries of the rich and sudden wisdom , the film becomes a sermon for most of its running time .

4126	positive	Try as you might to resist , if you 've got a place in your heart for Smokey Robinson , this movie will worm its way there .
1343	neutral	I have no problem with `` difficult '' movies , or movies that ask the audience to meet them halfway and connect the dots instead of having things all spelled out .
1841	negative	However sincere it may be , The Rising Place never quite justifies its own existence .
489	positive	There is a strong directorial stamp on every frame of this stylish film that is able to visualize schizophrenia but is still confident enough to step back and look at the sick character with a sane eye .
4692	negative	We never truly come to care about the main characters and whether or not they 'll wind up together , and Michele 's spiritual quest is neither amusing nor dramatic enough to sustain interest .
6456	negative	Bogdanich is unashamedly pro-Serbian and makes little attempt to give voice to the other side .

4972	positive	Wise and deadpan humorous .
7052	positive	Remember it .
403	positive	Notwithstanding my problem with the movie 's final half hour , I 'm going to recommend SECRETARY , based on the wonderful acting clinic put on by Spader and Gyllenhaal , and also the unique way Shainberg goes about telling what at heart is a sweet little girl -

2744	positive	You come away from his film overwhelmed , hopeful and , perhaps paradoxically , illuminated .
6519	negative	At every opportunity to do something clever , the film goes right over the edge and kills every sense of believability ... all you have left is a no-surprise series of explosions and violence while Banderas looks like he 's not trying to laugh at how bad it

2877	negative	Take Care is nicely performed by a quintet of actresses , but nonetheless it drags during its 112-minute length .

6256	negative	This thing works on no level whatsoever for me .
1644	positive	A zinger-filled crowd-pleaser that open-minded Elvis fans -LRB- but by no means all -RRB- will have fun with .
4226	negative	Even when Crush departs from the 4W formula ... it feels like a glossy rehash .
2946	neutral	The images are usually abbreviated in favor of mushy obviousness and telegraphed pathos , particularly where Whitaker 's misfit artist is concerned .
5830	negative	`` Sorority Boys '' was funnier , and that movie was pretty bad .
5643	positive	An older cad instructs a younger lad in Zen and the art of getting laid in this prickly indie comedy of manners and misanthropy .
523	positive	Highly recommended as an engrossing story about a horrifying historical event and the elements which contributed to it .
2189	positive	Cho 's timing is priceless .
2578	negative	We have poignancy jostling against farce , thoughtful dialogue elbowed aside by one-liners , and a visual style that incorporates rotoscope animation for no apparent reason except , maybe , that it looks neat .
1657	positive	Deliciously mean-spirited and wryly observant .
2035	positive	Bring on the sequel .
4033	positive	After an uncertain start , Murder hits and generally sustains a higher plateau with Bullock 's memorable first interrogation of Gosling .
7170	negative	... the story is far-flung , illogical , and plain stupid .
4910	negative	It 's dull , spiritless , silly and monotonous : an ultra-loud blast of pointless mayhem , going nowhere fast .
807	negative	Execrable .
5248	negative	Has enough gun battles and throwaway humor to cover up the yawning chasm where the plot should be .
6413	negative	This is not one of the movies you 'd want to watch if you only had a week to live .
6411	neutral	It 's an often-cute film but either needs more substance to fill the time or some judicious editing .
1151	neutral	Lavishly , exhilaratingly tasteless .
3798	negative	Bean drops the ball too many times ... hoping the nifty premise will create enough interest to make up for an unfocused screenplay .
5476	neutral	But not a whit more .
4960	negative	No amount of nostalgia for Carvey 's glory days can disguise the fact that the new film is a lame kiddie flick and that Carvey 's considerable talents are wasted in it .
5257	positive	And the reason for that is a self-aware , often self-mocking , intelligence .
7260	positive	It falls far short of poetry , but it 's not bad prose .
5625	positive	Arguably the best script that Besson has written in years .
5492	neutral	An overly melodramatic but somewhat insightful French coming-of-age film ...
1260	positive	... a light , yet engrossing piece .
913	neutral	Opening with some contrived banter , cliches and some loose ends , the screenplay only comes into its own in the second half .
4605	negative	It 's exactly the kind of movie Toback 's detractors always accuse him of making .
6049	negative	Deuces Wild is an encyclopedia of cliches that shoplifts shamelessly from farewell-to-innocence movies like The Wanderers and A Bronx Tale without cribbing any of their intelligence .
2532	negative	Ozpetek offers an AIDS subtext , skims over the realities of gay sex , and presents yet another tired old vision of the gay community as an all-inclusive world where uptight , middle class bores like Antonia can feel good about themselves .
2771	neutral	Y
4729	neutral	A movie that feels like the pilot episode of a new teen-targeted action TV series .
1215	positive	Oh , look at that clever angle !
3580	neutral	Eckstraordinarily lame and Severely boring .
4780	positive	Takashi Miike keeps pushing the envelope : Ichi the Killer
6927	negative	It 's a strange film , one that was hard for me to warm up to .
6414	negative	It all seemed wasted like DeNiro 's once promising career and the once grand Long Beach boardwalk .
3684	positive	What 's surprising about this traditional thriller , moderately successful but not completely satisfying , is exactly how genteel and unsurprising the execution turns out to be .
7093	positive	A film of delicate interpersonal dances .
8486	negative	Girlfriends are bad , wives are worse and babies are the kiss of death in this bitter Italian comedy .
5384	negative	The package in which this fascinating -- and timely -- content comes wrapped is disappointingly generic .
4022	positive	As warm as it is wise , deftly setting off uproarious humor with an underlying seriousness that sneaks up on the viewer , providing an experience that is richer than anticipated .
8301	negative	Supposedly authentic account of a historical event that 's far too tragic to merit such superficial treatment .
8264	negative	The result is an ` action film ' mired in stasis .
1515	negative	-LRB- Soderbergh -RRB- tends to place most of the psychological and philosophical material in italics rather than trust an audience 's intelligence , and he creates an overall sense of brusqueness .
7625	positive	`` Auto Focus '' works as an unusual biopic and document of male swingers in the Playboy era
2429	positive	Cool .
7326	positive	But believe it or not , it 's one of the most beautiful , evocative works I 've seen .
764	positive	It 's a movie that accomplishes so much that one viewing ca n't possibly be enough .
7192	neutral	For all of its insights into the dream world of teen life , and its electronic expression through cyber culture
899	negative	The film has -LRB- its -RRB- moments , but they are few and far between .
1124	positive	The film is one of the year 's best .
4085	negative	even after 90 minutes of playing opposite each other Bullock and Grant still look ill at ease sharing the same scene .
2086	neutral	This is a harrowing movie about how parents know where all the buttons are , and how to push them .
3664	negative	Seemingly disgusted with the lazy material and the finished product 's unshapely look , director Fisher Stevens inexplicably dips key moments from the film in Waking Life water colors .
8189	positive	Humorous and heartfelt , Douglas McGrath 's version of ` Nicholas Nickleby ' left me feeling refreshed and hopeful .
5204	positive	A funny film .
6148	positive	One of the most splendid entertainments to emerge from the French film industry in years .
5395	positive	Simone is not a bad film .
3319	negative	Hopelessly inane , humorless and under-inspired .
788	positive	I love the opening scenes of a wintry New York City in 1899 .
8002	negative	Normally , Rohmer 's talky films fascinate me , but when he moves his setting to the past , and relies on a historical text , he loses the richness of characterization that makes his films so memorable .
8384	positive	A powerful performance from Mel Gibson and a brutal 90-minute battle sequence that does everything but issue you a dog-tag and an M-16 .
5099	positive	Lux , now in her eighties , does a great combination act as narrator , Jewish grandmother and subject -- taking us through a film that is part biography , part entertainment and part history .
5447	positive	Its use of the thriller form to examine the labyrinthine ways in which people 's lives cross and change , buffeted by events seemingly out of their control , is intriguing , provocative stuff .
6547	negative	Hollywood Ending is the most disappointing Woody Allen movie ever .
2613	positive	No , it 's not as single-minded as John Carpenter 's original , but it 's sure a lot smarter and more unnerving than the sequels .
687	positive	Director Claude Chabrol has become the master of innuendo .
3427	positive	A movie that sends you out of the theater feeling like you 've actually spent time living in another community .
7823	negative	A decided lack of spontaneity in its execution and a dearth of real poignancy in its epiphanies .
8427	positive	More mature than Fatal Attraction , more complete than Indecent Proposal and more relevant than 9 1\/2 Weeks , Unfaithful is at once intimate and universal cinema .
4730	negative	It 's replaced by some dramatic scenes that are jarring and deeply out of place in what could have -LRB- and probably should have -RRB- been a lighthearted comedy .
1906	negative	The type of dumbed-down exercise in stereotypes that gives the -LRB- teen comedy -RRB- genre a bad name .
4795	negative	A backhanded ode to female camaraderie penned by a man who has little clue about either the nature of women or of friendship .
3557	negative	This thing is just garbage .
6267	negative	This mistaken-identity picture is so film-culture referential that the final product is a ghost .
5699	neutral	Oh , and Booty Call .
6794	neutral	Then Nadia 's birthday might not have been such a bad day after all .
5512	positive	Aside from Rohmer 's bold choices regarding point of view , The Lady and the Duke represents the filmmaker 's lifelong concern with formalist experimentation in cinematic art .
3901	negative	I 'm not exactly sure what this movie thinks it is about .
1285	neutral	There 's something not entirely convincing about The Quiet American .
1273	neutral	Pedro Rodrigues '
6631	negative	It 's fitting that a movie as artificial and soulless as The Country Bears owes its genesis to an animatronic display at Disneyland .
8276	negative	Follows the original film virtually scene for scene and yet manages to bleed it almost completely dry of humor , verve and fun .
4892	neutral	It 's a fanboy ` what if ? '
2110	positive	In the disturbingly involving family dysfunctional drama How I Killed My Father , French director Anne Fontaine delivers an inspired portrait of male-ridden angst and the emotional blockage that accompanies this human condition
1202	positive	It 's far from a frothy piece , and the characters are complex , laden with plenty of baggage and tinged with tragic undertones .
8388	negative	It 's a big idea , but the film itself is small and shriveled .
3711	neutral	Less-than-compelling documentary of a Yiddish theater clan .
6130	positive	As action-adventure , this space-based homage to Robert Louis Stevenson 's Treasure Island fires on all plasma conduits .
7805	neutral	Summer 's far too fleeting to squander on offal like this .
3606	neutral	and `` They 're coming ! ''
7627	positive	Max pokes , provokes , takes expressionistic license and hits a nerve ... as far as art is concerned , it 's mission accomplished .
8177	negative	Like many such biographical melodramas , it suffers from the awkwardness that results from adhering to the messiness of true stories .
4313	positive	Smart , sassy interpretation of the Oscar Wilde play .
7417	positive	An amused indictment of Jaglom 's own profession .
1475	negative	Ritchie 's film is easier to swallow than Wertmuller 's polemical allegory , but it 's self-defeatingly decorous .
7839	negative	This is an ungainly movie , ill-fitting , with its elbows sticking out where the knees should be .
6570	negative	That neither protagonist has a distinguishable condition hardly matters because both are just actory concoctions , defined by childlike dimness and a handful of quirks .
5266	positive	I could n't recommend this film more .
6949	negative	mired in a shabby script
2795	neutral	As it stands it 's an opera movie for the buffs .
4575	negative	It 's all arty and jazzy and people sit and stare and turn away from one another instead of talking and it 's all about the silences and if you 're into that , have at it .
3287	neutral	Colorful and deceptively buoyant until it suddenly pulls the rug out from under you , Burkinabe filmmaker Dani Kouyate 's reworking of a folk story whose roots go back to 7th-century oral traditions is also a pointed political allegory .
5244	negative	... really horrible drek .
7820	positive	The film fits into a genre that has been overexposed , redolent of a thousand cliches , and yet remains uniquely itself , vibrant with originality .
7426	negative	An undistinguished attempt to make a classic theater piece cinematic .
7753	negative	This is rote drivel aimed at Mom and Dad 's wallet .
5653	negative	A predictable , manipulative stinker .
8231	negative	Though an important political documentary , this does not really make the case the Kissinger should be tried as a war criminal .
4168	negative	This is Sandler running on empty , repeating what he 's already done way too often .
2739	positive	Has a solid emotional impact .
7488	negative	under-rehearsed and lifeless
5049	negative	It 's impossible to even categorize this as a smutty guilty pleasure .
7272	positive	A fine documentary can be distinguished from a mediocre one by the better film 's ability to make its subject interesting to those who are n't part of its supposed target audience .
1385	positive	If you like an extreme action-packed film with a hint of humor , then Triple X marks the spot .
167	negative	Has no reason to exist , other than to employ Hollywood kids and people who owe favors to their famous parents .
335	positive	The cast delivers without sham the raw-nerved story .
6982	negative	... an hour-and-a-half of inoffensive , unmemorable filler .
4882	positive	Diaz , Applegate , Blair and Posey are suitably kooky which should appeal to women and they strip down often enough to keep men alert , if not amused .
5119	positive	Great fun both for sports aficionados and for ordinary louts whose idea of exercise is climbing the steps of a stadium-seat megaplex .
2789	neutral	`` What John does is heroic , but we do n't condone it , '' one of the film 's stars recently said , a tortuous comment that perfectly illustrates the picture 's moral schizophrenia .
1390	positive	Like any good romance , Son of the Bride , proves it 's never too late to learn .
8120	positive	Mr. Caine and Mr. Fraser are the whole show here , with their memorable and resourceful performances .
5878	negative	It 's a hellish , numbing experience to watch , and it does n't offer any insights that have n't been thoroughly debated in the media already , back in the Dahmer heyday of the mid - '90s .
7437	positive	It 's tough to watch , but it 's a fantastic movie .
8124	positive	The picture runs a mere 84 minutes , but it 's no glance .
4499	negative	Even Murphy 's expert comic timing and famed charisma ca n't rescue this effort .
8292	positive	The film 's images give a backbone to the company and provide an emotional edge to its ultimate demise .
5047	positive	While there 's likely very little crossover appeal to those without much interest in the Elizabethans -LRB- as well as rank frustration from those in the know about Rubbo 's dumbed-down tactics -RRB- , Much Ado About Something is an amicable endeavor .
1764	negative	It may as well be called `` Jar-Jar Binks : The Movie . ''
5134	positive	Leigh makes these lives count .
7026	positive	It 's a technically superb film , shining with all the usual Spielberg flair , expertly utilizing the talents of his top-notch creative team .
3463	neutral	While this gentle and affecting melodrama will have luvvies in raptures , it 's far too slight and introspective to appeal to anything wider than a niche audience .
3002	negative	Even accepting this in the right frame of mind can only provide it with so much leniency .
6469	positive	Young Hanks and Fisk , who vaguely resemble their celebrity parents , bring fresh good looks and an ease in front of the camera to the work .
5259	positive	Could I have been more geeked when I heard that Apollo 13 was going to be released in IMAX format ?
156	positive	In the director 's cut , the film is not only a love song to the movies but it also is more fully an example of the kind of lush , all-enveloping movie experience it rhapsodizes .
2824	neutral	, with cheapo animation -LRB- like Saturday morning TV in the '60s -RRB- , a complex sword-and-sorcery plot and characters who all have big round eyes and Japanese names .
3849	positive	The acting in Pauline And Paulette is good all round , but what really sets the film apart is Debrauwer 's refusal to push the easy emotional buttons .
6721	negative	This dreadfully earnest inversion of the Concubine love triangle eschews the previous film 's historical panorama and roiling pathos for bug-eyed mugging and gay-niche condescension .
2698	positive	Wilco fans will have a great time , and the movie should win the band a few new converts , too .
3236	neutral	There are far worse messages to teach a young audience , which will probably be perfectly happy with the sloppy slapstick comedy .
4686	negative	No film could possibly be more contemptuous of the single female population .
4774	neutral	I 'll put it this way : If you 're in the mood for a melodrama narrated by talking fish , this is the movie for you .
2588	negative	If there was any doubt that Peter O'Fallon did n't have an original bone in his body , A Rumor of Angels should dispel it .
851	negative	The beautiful images and solemn words can not disguise the slack complacency of -LRB- Godard 's -RRB- vision , any more than the gorgeous piano and strings on the soundtrack can drown out the tinny self-righteousness of his voice .
5976	negative	A not-so-Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood with a hefty helping of Re-Fried Green Tomatoes .
1782	neutral	... they missed the boat .
6663	neutral	Has the marks of a septuagenarian ; it 's a crusty treatment of a clever gimmick .
4066	negative	`` Solaris '' is a shapeless inconsequential move relying on the viewer to do most of the work .
7941	negative	For something as splendid-looking as this particular film , the viewer expects something special but instead gets -LRB- sci-fi -RRB- rehash .
6531	negative	Just another generic drama that has nothing going for it other than its exploitive array of obligatory cheap thrills .
5268	positive	Nair 's cast is so large it 's Altman-esque , but she deftly spins the multiple stories in a vibrant and intoxicating fashion .
3481	positive	Lovely and Amazing is Holofcener 's deep , uncompromising curtsy to women she knows , and very likely is .
1861	neutral	If you do n't laugh , flee .
4089	positive	The Rock is destined to be the 21st Century 's new `` Conan '' and that he 's going to make a splash even greater than Arnold Schwarzenegger , Jean-Claud Van Damme or Steven Segal .
7349	positive	Though the story ... is hackneyed , the characters have a freshness and modesty that transcends their predicament .
5128	positive	Austin Powers for the most part is extremely funny , the first part making up for any flaws that come later .
8165	positive	Especially give credit to Affleck .
4631	negative	Plays like one of those conversations that Comic Book Guy on `` The Simpsons '' has .
6305	positive	Witty , contemplative , and sublimely beautiful .
7305	positive	The quirky and recessive charms of co-stars Martin Donovan and Mary-Louise Parker help overcome the problematic script .
5485	negative	ZigZag might have been richer and more observant if it were less densely plotted .
3926	positive	A vibrant whirlwind of love , family and all that goes with it , My Big Fat Greek Wedding is a non-stop funny feast of warmth , colour and cringe .
5599	positive	Watching Austin Powers in Goldmember is like binging on cotton candy .
108	neutral	The narrative is so consistently unimaginative that probably the only way to have saved the film is with the aid of those wisecracking Mystery Science Theater 3000 guys .
4329	positive	It works its magic with such exuberance and passion that the film 's length becomes a part of its fun .
1227	positive	Compellingly watchable .
6025	positive	The film boasts dry humor and jarring shocks , plus moments of breathtaking mystery .
5853	positive	When a movie has stuck around for this long , you know there 's something there .
2102	neutral	Benigni 's Pinocchio is extremely straight and mind-numbingly stilted , its episodic pacing keeping the film from developing any storytelling flow .
1566	positive	Miller comes at film with bracing intelligence and a vision both painterly and literary .
5665	neutral	The Ring is worth a look , if you do n't demand much more than a few cheap thrills from your Halloween entertainment .
5896	negative	The film never finds its tone and several scenes run too long .
3778	negative	We assume he had a bad run in the market or a costly divorce , because there is no earthly reason other than money why this distinguished actor would stoop so low .
5903	negative	Unfortunately , the experience of actually watching the movie is less compelling than the circumstances of its making .
8238	neutral	Although bright , well-acted and thought-provoking , Tuck Everlasting suffers from a laconic pace and a lack of traditional action .
8318	positive	Rarely , indeed almost never , is such high-wattage brainpower coupled with pitch-perfect acting and an exquisite , unfakable sense of cinema .
6590	neutral	The film 's heady yet far from impenetrable theory suggests that Russians take comfort in their closed-off nationalist reality .
6576	neutral	Who are ` they ' ?
7640	positive	Plays out with a dogged and eventually winning squareness that would make it the darling of many a kids-and-family-oriented cable channel .
2186	positive	The entire cast is extraordinarily good .
1747	neutral	Far-fetched premise , convoluted plot , and thematic mumbo jumbo about destiny and redemptive love .
6641	negative	Nothing about the film -- with the possible exception of Elizabeth Hurley 's breasts -- is authentic .
4658	positive	Boasts a handful of virtuosic set pieces and offers a fair amount of trashy , kinky fun .
3456	positive	Happily stays close to the ground in a spare and simple manner and does n't pummel us with phony imagery or music .
3063	negative	77 minutes of Pokemon may not last 4ever , it just seems like it does .
2551	neutral	One thing is for sure : This movie does not tell you a whole lot about Lily Chou-Chou .
8040	negative	Epps has neither the charisma nor the natural affability that has made Tucker a star .
3616	positive	The exploitative , clumsily staged violence overshadows everything , including most of the actors .
2124	positive	-LRB- City -RRB- reminds us how realistically nuanced a Robert De Niro performance can be when he is not more lucratively engaged in the shameless self-caricature of ` Analyze This ' -LRB- 1999 -RRB- and ` Analyze That , ' promised -LRB- or threatened -RRB- for later this year .
422	negative	Solondz may well be the only one laughing at his own joke
548	negative	After that it becomes long and tedious like a classroom play in a college history course .
3200	positive	There 's no denying that Burns is a filmmaker with a bright future ahead of him .
8391	negative	The film lapses too often into sugary sentiment and withholds delivery on the pell-mell pyrotechnics its punchy style promises .
2844	positive	It 's a ripper of a yarn and I for one enjoyed the thrill of the chill .
4286	negative	Rymer does n't trust laughs -- and does n't conjure proper respect for followers of the whole dead-undead genre , who deserve more from a vampire pic than a few shrieky special effects .
5220	negative	Rollerball IS as bad as you think , and worse than you can imagine .
7860	positive	Runs on the pure adrenalin of Pacino 's performance .
3532	neutral	Has an uppity musical beat that you can dance to , but its energy ca n't compare to the wit , humor and snappy dialogue of the original .
5736	negative	` Punch-Drunk Love is so convinced of its own brilliance that , if it were a person , you 'd want to smash its face in . '
2099	negative	The fact that the ` best part ' of the movie comes from a 60-second homage to one of Demme 's good films does n't bode well for the rest of it .
4412	negative	We do n't even like their characters .
7502	negative	Seagal is painfully foolish in trying to hold onto what 's left of his passe ' chopsocky glory .
3235	neutral	Abderrahmane Sissako 's Heremakono -LRB- Waiting for Happiness -RRB- is an elegiac portrait of a transit city on the West African coast struggling against foreign influences .
2929	neutral	Both the crime story and the love story are unusual .
1218	neutral	Since Lee is a sentimentalist , the film is more worshipful than your random E !
3483	positive	A metaphor for a modern-day urban China searching for its identity .
5014	neutral	Whereas the extremely competent hitman films such as Pulp Fiction and Get Shorty resonate a sardonic verve to their caustic purpose for existing , Who Is Cletis Tout ?
6052	negative	Louiso lets the movie dawdle in classic disaffected-indie-film mode , and brother Hoffman 's script stumbles over a late-inning twist that just does n't make sense .
4742	positive	Meyjes ' provocative film might be called an example of the haphazardness of evil .
7425	negative	This is a movie so insecure about its capacity to excite that it churns up not one but two flagrantly fake thunderstorms to underscore the action .

2456	positive	Funny and also heartwarming without stooping to gooeyness .

1310	positive	Ya-Yas everywhere will forgive the flaws and love the film .
2523	negative	The weird thing about The Santa Clause 2 , purportedly a children 's movie , is that there is nothing in it to engage children emotionally .
5543	negative	From the choppy editing to the annoying score to ` special effects ' by way of replacing objects in a character 's hands below the camera line , `` Besotted '' is misbegotten
918	neutral	While this has the making of melodrama , the filmmaker cuts against this natural grain , producing a work that 's more interested in asking questions than in answering them .
3941	positive	Combine the paranoid claustrophobia of a submarine movie with the unsettling spookiness of the supernatural -- why did n't Hollywood think of this sooner ?
6359	positive	It finds its moviegoing pleasures in the tiny events that could make a person who has lived her life half-asleep suddenly wake up and take notice .
4280	positive	The direction has a fluid , no-nonsense authority , and the performances by Harris , Phifer and Cam ` ron seal the deal .
3422	negative	Derailed by bad writing and possibly also by some of that extensive post-production reworking to aim the film at young males in the throes of their first full flush of testosterone .
6983	negative	It 's not a bad premise , just a bad movie .
2806	negative	Odd and weird .
5934	negative	Blood Work is laughable in the solemnity with which it tries to pump life into overworked elements from Eastwood 's Dirty Harry period .
5301	positive	Though the aboriginal aspect lends the ending an extraordinary poignancy , and the story itself could be played out in any working class community in the nation .
3097	positive	Still , the updated Dickensian sensibility of writer Craig Bartlett 's story is appealing .
3905	negative	The script , the gags , the characters are all direct-to-video stuff , and that 's where this film should have remained .
232	negative	Phoned-in business as usual .
8013	negative	It sounds like another clever if pointless excursion into the abyss , and that 's more or less how it plays out .
5875	negative	The whole affair , true story or not , feels incredibly hokey ... -LRB- it -RRB- comes off like a Hallmark commercial .
537	negative	Not that any of us should be complaining when a film clocks in around 90 minutes these days , but the plotting here leaves a lot to be desired .
1817	negative	Despite the opulent lushness of every scene , the characters never seem to match the power of their surroundings .
130	positive	A triumph , a film that hews out a world and carries us effortlessly from darkness to light .
2155	positive	Hatosy ... portrays young Brendan with his usual intelligence and subtlety , not to mention a convincing brogue .
4402	neutral	Hardman is a grating , mannered onscreen presence , which is especially unfortunate in light of the fine work done by most of the rest of her cast .
1950	neutral	In his determination to lighten the heavy subject matter , Silberling also , to a certain extent , trivializes the movie with too many nervous gags and pratfalls .
892	negative	`` Abandon '' will leave you wanting to abandon the theater .
7193	positive	This comic gem is as delightful as it is derivative .
5732	positive	There 's nothing more satisfying during a summer of event movies than a spy thriller like The Bourne Identity that 's packed with just as much intelligence as action .
3614	negative	Not completely loveable -- but what underdog movie since The Bad News Bears has been ?
2157	neutral	... Jones , despite a definitely distinctive screen presence , just is n't able to muster for a movie that , its title notwithstanding , should have been a lot nastier if it wanted to fully capitalize on its lead 's specific gifts .
6149	positive	As the movie traces Mr. Brown 's athletic exploits , it is impossible not to be awed by the power and grace of one of the greatest natural sportsmen of modern times .
1210	negative	A so-so , made-for-TV something posing as a real movie .
5589	negative	You emerge dazed , confused as to whether you 've seen pornography or documentary .
3725	positive	Will warm your heart without making you feel guilty about it .
5190	negative	An unencouraging threefold expansion on the former MTV series , accompanying the stunt-hungry dimwits in a random series of collected gags , pranks , pratfalls , dares , injuries , etc. .
746	positive	The large-frame IMAX camera lends itself beautifully to filming the teeming life on the reefs , making this gorgeous film a must for everyone from junior scientists to grown-up fish lovers .
3351	neutral	I know we 're not supposed to take it seriously , but I ca n't shake the thought that Undercover Brother missed an opportunity to strongly present some profound social commentary .
4918	positive	Playfully profound ... and crazier than Michael Jackson on the top floor of a skyscraper nursery surrounded by open windows .
3128	negative	Too silly to take seriously .
719	negative	None of Birthday Girl 's calculated events take us by surprise ...
2668	positive	This is one of those war movies that focuses on human interaction rather than battle and action sequences ... and it 's all the stronger because of it .
6879	negative	Of all the Halloween 's , this is the most visually unappealing .
2409	negative	The only fun part of the movie is playing the obvious game .
5460	positive	To call this one an eventual cult classic would be an understatement , and woe is the horror fan who opts to overlook this goofily endearing and well-lensed gorefest .
5725	positive	Not to mention absolutely refreshed .
6902	positive	As simple and innocent a movie as you can imagine .
7571	positive	The cast ... keeps this pretty watchable , and casting Mick Jagger as director of the escort service was inspired .
5112	negative	This stuck pig of a movie flails limply between bizarre comedy and pallid horror .
7039	positive	The gags that fly at such a furiously funny pace that the only rip off that we were aware of was the one we felt when the movie ended so damned soon .
6417	negative	The story is bogus and its characters tissue-thin .
8421	neutral	Rob Schneider , Dana Carvey and Sarah Michelle Gellar in The Philadelphia Story ?
5195	positive	Generates an enormous feeling of empathy for its characters .
1535	neutral	Another in a long line of ultra-violent war movies , this one is not quite what it could have been as a film , but the story and theme make up for it .
1599	positive	You may feel compelled to watch the film twice or pick up a book on the subject .
5305	positive	Brings together some of the biggest names in Japanese anime , with impressive results .
6914	negative	The film 's needlessly opaque intro takes its doe-eyed Crudup out of pre-9 \/ 11 New York and onto a cross-country road trip of the Homeric kind .
4018	neutral	Critics need a good laugh , too , and this too-extreme-for-TV rendition of the notorious MTV show delivers the outrageous , sickening , sidesplitting goods in steaming , visceral heaps .
511	negative	One Hour Photo may seem disappointing in its generalities , but it 's the little nuances that perhaps had to escape from director Mark Romanek 's self-conscious scrutiny to happen , that finally get under your skin .
1981	negative	So muddled , repetitive and ragged that it says far less about the horrifying historical reality than about the filmmaker 's characteristic style .
7808	neutral	Post 9\/11 the philosophical message of `` Personal Freedom First '' might not be as palatable as intended .
1244	positive	This is a smart movie that knows its classical music , knows its Freud and knows its Sade .
6660	neutral	A romance ?
663	positive	Brings to a spectacular completion one of the most complex , generous and subversive artworks of the last decade .
1056	positive	... a delightfully unpredictable , hilarious comedy with wonderful performances that tug at your heart in ways that utterly transcend gender labels .
5820	positive	The script by David Koepp is perfectly serviceable and because he gives the story some soul ... he elevates the experience to a more mythic level .
6602	negative	A piece of mildly entertaining , inoffensive fluff that drifts aimlessly for 90 minutes before lodging in the cracks of that ever-growing category : unembarrassing but unmemorable .
2493	positive	Like Edward Norton in American History X , Ryan Gosling -LRB- Murder By Numbers -RRB- delivers a magnetic performance .
3985	neutral	John Carlen 's script is full of unhappy , two-dimensional characters who are anything but compelling .
1314	neutral	Cold and scattered , Minority Report commands interest almost solely as an exercise in gorgeous visuals .
7833	negative	A spooky yarn of demonic doings on the high seas that works better the less the brain is engaged .
4837	positive	It is a strength of a documentary to disregard available bias , especially as temptingly easy as it would have been with this premise .
4518	negative	Writer-director Stephen Gaghan has made the near-fatal mistake of being what the English call ` too clever by half . '
8194	negative	It does n't take a rocket scientist to figure out that this is a Mormon family movie , and a sappy , preachy one at that .
658	negative	Cacoyannis ' vision is far less mature , interpreting the play as a call for pity and sympathy for anachronistic phantasms haunting the imagined glory of their own pasts .
2232	positive	A creepy , intermittently powerful study of a self-destructive man ... about as unsettling to watch as an exploratory medical procedure or an autopsy .
2957	neutral	With its jerky hand-held camera and documentary feel , Bloody Sunday is a sobering recount of a very bleak day in Derry .
346	negative	Fails so fundamentally on every conventional level that it achieves some kind of goofy grandeur .
3352	positive	As a good old-fashioned adventure for kids , Spirit : Stallion of the Cimarron is a winner .
3709	positive	The strength of the film lies in its two central performances by Sven Wollter as the stricken composer and Viveka Seldahl as his desperate violinist wife .
2103	negative	A pale Xerox of other , better crime movies .
5414	positive	Just about the best straight-up , old-school horror film of the last 15 years .
1135	negative	In between all the emotional seesawing , it 's hard to figure the depth of these two literary figures , and even the times in which they lived .
8145	neutral	The problem is not that it 's all derivative , because plenty of funny movies recycle old tropes .
6344	positive	It 's a hoot watching The Rock chomp on jumbo ants , pull an arrow out of his back , and leap unscathed through raging fire !
3116	neutral	-LRB- Javier Bardem is -RRB- one of the few reasons to watch the film , which director Gerardo Vera has drenched in swoony music and fever-pitched melodrama .
4015	positive	Evelyn 's strong cast and surehanded direction make for a winning , heartwarming yarn .
5284	neutral	It 's got some pretentious eye-rolling moments and it did n't entirely grab me , but there 's stuff here to like .
2173	positive	Sly , sophisticated and surprising .
8143	positive	Douglas McGrath 's Nicholas Nickleby does Dickens as it should be done cinematically .
4072	positive	He makes you realize that deep inside righteousness can be found a tough beauty .
2084	positive	If the film has a problem , its shortness disappoints : You want the story to go on and on .
7100	negative	A listless and desultory affair .
6044	negative	It 's so crammed with scenes and vistas and pretty moments that it 's left a few crucial things out , like character development and coherence .
4114	positive	Raimi crafted a complicated hero who is a welcome relief from the usual two-dimensional offerings .
8139	negative	I 'm not sure these words have ever been together in the same sentence : This erotic cannibal movie is boring .
6840	positive	The film presents visceral and dangerously honest revelations about the men and machines behind the curtains of our planet .
4345	neutral	Performances are potent , and the women 's stories are ably intercut and involving .
3723	neutral	Possession is in the end an honorable , interesting failure .
3980	positive	Not the Great American Comedy , but if you liked the previous movies in the series , you 'll have a good time with this one too .
492	negative	As saccharine as it is disposable .
5243	negative	Less a study in madness or love than a study in schoolgirl obsession .
2879	negative	Formula 51 promises a new kind of high but delivers the same old bad trip .
8037	neutral	A flawed film but an admirable one that tries to immerse us in a world of artistic abandon and political madness and very nearly succeeds .
7267	neutral	Confounding because it solemnly advances a daringly preposterous thesis .
3168	neutral	If Sinise 's character had a brain his ordeal would be over in five minutes but instead the plot goes out of its way to introduce obstacles for him to stumble over .
2811	negative	In any case , I would recommend Big Bad Love only to Winger fans who have missed her since 1995 's Forget Paris .
7219	negative	A rote exercise in both animation and storytelling .
3892	negative	One big blustery movie where nothing really happens .
155	negative	... stale and uninspired .
3127	negative	The movie weighs no more than a glass of flat champagne .
7516	negative	Whatever satire Lucky Break was aiming for , it certainly got lost in the `` soon-to-be-forgettable '' section of the quirky rip-off prison romp pile .
5373	negative	The only question ... is to determine how well the schmaltz is manufactured -- to assess the quality of the manipulative engineering .
6133	neutral	Unintelligible , poorly acted , brain-slappingly bad , Harvard Man is ludicrous enough that it could become a cult classic .
166	negative	Kim Ki-Deok seems to have in mind an -LRB- emotionally at least -RRB- adolescent audience demanding regular shocks and bouts of barely defensible sexual violence to keep it interested .
6396	negative	Deserving of its critical backlash and more .
8521	positive	A witty , whimsical feature debut .
2735	neutral	Really dumb but occasionally really funny .
400	positive	Despite its flaws ... Belinsky is still able to create an engaging story that keeps you guessing at almost every turn .
4640	negative	Starts promisingly but disintegrates into a dreary , humorless soap opera .
4985	negative	True to its animatronic roots : ... as stiff , ponderous and charmless as a mechanical apparatus ... ` The Country Bears ' should never have been brought out of hibernation .
4252	positive	Family fare .
4628	negative	We 're left with a story that tries to grab us , only to keep letting go at all the wrong moments .
5724	negative	Unfortunately , there is almost nothing in this flat effort that will amuse or entertain them , either .
7134	negative	It 's mildly sentimental , unabashedly consumerist ... studiously inoffensive and completely disposable .
8512	neutral	A sly dissection of the inanities of the contemporary music business and a rather sad story of the difficulties of artistic collaboration .
6862	negative	What Madonna does here ca n't properly be called acting -- more accurately , it 's moving and it 's talking and it 's occasionally gesturing , sometimes all at once .
7476	positive	A reminder that beyond all the hype and recent digital glitz , Spielberg knows how to tell us about people .
2185	negative	Upper West Sidey exercise in narcissism and self-congratulation disguised as a tribute .
5932	negative	-LRB- A -RRB- stale retread of the '53 original .
363	negative	Stupid , infantile , redundant , sloppy , over-the-top , and amateurish .
3552	negative	Despite suffering a sense-of-humour failure , The Man Who Wrote Rocky does not deserve to go down with a ship as leaky as this .
7922	negative	In the end , there is n't much to it .
3211	positive	The campy results make Mel Brooks ' Borscht Belt schtick look sophisticated .
3953	neutral	Boldly engineering a collision between tawdry B-movie flamboyance and grandiose spiritual anomie , Rose 's film , true to its source material , provides a tenacious demonstration of death as the great equalizer .
472	positive	Definitely funny stuff , but it 's more of the ` laughing at ' variety than the ` laughing with . '
5364	negative	In all the annals of the movies , few films have been this odd , inexplicable and unpleasant .
160	positive	An uncluttered , resonant gem that relays its universal points without lectures or confrontations . '
7146	neutral	Ends up being mostly about ravishing costumes , eye-filling , wide-screen production design and Joan 's wacky decision to stand by her man , no matter how many times he demonstrates that he 's a disloyal satyr .
7536	positive	The mushy finale turns John Q into a movie-of-the-week tearjerker .
6366	neutral	Personal Velocity ought to be exploring these women 's inner lives , but it never moves beyond their surfaces .
1783	negative	Characterisation has been sacrificed for the sake of spectacle .
2329	negative	This is a fudged opportunity of gigantic proportions -- a lunar mission with no signs of life .
5925	negative	You 'll just have your head in your hands wondering why Lee 's character did n't just go to a bank manager and save everyone the misery .
5231	negative	One key problem with these ardently Christian storylines is that there is never any question of how things will turn out .
615	negative	Unfortunately the story and the actors are served with a hack script .
8509	positive	The film is reasonably entertaining , though it begins to drag two-thirds through , when the melodramatic aspects start to overtake the comedy .
1696	negative	Take away the controversy , and it 's not much more watchable than a Mexican soap opera .
5869	positive	The quirky drama touches the heart and the funnybone thanks to the energetic and always surprising performance by Rachel Griffiths .
2229	positive	The film boasts at least a few good ideas and features some decent performances , but the result is disappointing .
2903	neutral	The Pinochet Case is a searing album of remembrance from those who , having survived , suffered most .
1282	negative	We hate -LRB- Madonna -RRB- within the film 's first five minutes , and she lacks the skill or presence to regain any ground .
2971	positive	Never lets go your emotions , taking them to surprising highs , sorrowful lows and hidden impulsive niches ... gorgeous , passionate , and at times uncommonly moving .
453	negative	A little more intensity and a little less charm would have saved this film a world of hurt .
7853	neutral	The power of this script , and the performances that come with it , is that the whole damned thing did n't get our moral hackles up .
4982	negative	Shallow .
7665	negative	He does n't , however , deliver nearly enough of the show 's trademark style and flash .
6391	positive	A remarkably insightful look at the backstage angst of the stand-up comic .
5283	positive	Sweetly sexy , funny and touching .
4932	positive	I liked a lot of the smaller scenes .
4836	positive	Demonstrates a vivid imagination and an impressive style that result in some terrific setpieces .
385	positive	Leguizamo and Jones are both excellent and the rest of the cast is uniformly superb .
2909	negative	If Welles was unhappy at the prospect of the human race splitting in two , he probably would n't be too crazy with his great-grandson 's movie splitting up in pretty much the same way .
924	positive	A pointed , often tender , examination of the pros and cons of unconditional love and familial duties .
3959	negative	preachy and
2584	neutral	Spend your Benjamins on a matinee .
1848	negative	Both deserve better .
4878	positive	If you 've the patience , there are great rewards here .
5692	positive	Everything about The Quiet American is good , except its timing .
6542	neutral	an insular world
2211	negative	Unfunny and lacking any sense of commitment to or affection for its characters , the Reginald Hudlin comedy relies on toilet humor , ethnic slurs .
5726	negative	My precious new Star Wars movie is a lumbering , wheezy drag ...
6765	neutral	If you want to see a train wreck that you ca n't look away from , then look no further , because here it is .
6113	positive	classic cinema served up with heart and humor
3313	positive	A moving and solidly entertaining comedy\/drama that should bolster director and co-writer
1153	negative	Richard Pryor mined his personal horrors and came up with a treasure chest of material , but Lawrence gives us mostly fool 's gold .
1279	negative	In the book-on-tape market , the film of `` The Kid Stays in the Picture '' would be an abridged edition
3464	negative	Where Tom Green stages his gags as assaults on America 's knee-jerk moral sanctimony , Jackass lacks aspirations of social upheaval .
3992	positive	While somewhat less than it might have been , the film is a good one , and you 've got to hand it to director George Clooney for biting off such a big job the first time out .
1272	positive	The Scorpion King is more fun than Conan the Barbarian .
2192	negative	... a weak and ineffective ghost story without a conclusion or pay off .
2367	neutral	C'mon !
7636	neutral	Although it does n't always hang together -- violence and whimsy do n't combine easily -- `` Cherish '' certainly is n't dull .
320	neutral	has -RRB-
283	neutral	I was sent a copyof this film to review on DVD .
665	neutral	You can see where Big Bad Love is trying to go , but it never quite gets there .
2822	positive	A stylish but steady , and ultimately very satisfying , piece of character-driven storytelling .
2780	positive	A tremendous piece of work .
2438	positive	-LRB- There 's -RRB- quite a bit of heart , as you would expect from the directors of The Little Mermaid and Aladdin .
5255	positive	It 's truly awful and heartbreaking subject matter , but one whose lessons are well worth revisiting as many times as possible .
7335	positive	Nakata 's technique is to imply terror by suggestion , rather than the overuse of special effects .
1359	neutral	With three excellent principal singers , a youthful and good-looking diva and tenor and richly handsome locations , it 's enough to make you wish Jacquot had left well enough alone and just filmed the opera without all these distortions of perspective .
8099	negative	One of those decades-spanning historical epics that strives to be intimate and socially encompassing but fails to do justice to either effort in three hours of screen time .
2004	neutral	Director David Jacobson gives Dahmer a consideration that the murderer never game his victims .
7836	positive	An unforgettable look at morality , family , and social expectation through the prism of that omnibus tradition called marriage .
773	positive	Charlotte Sometimes is a gem .
6674	negative	Though her fans will assuredly have their funny bones tickled , others will find their humor-seeking dollars best spent elsewhere .
7512	positive	An awfully good , achingly human picture .
4190	negative	They were afraid to show this movie to reviewers before its opening , afraid of the bad reviews they thought they 'd earn .
3803	negative	This is standard crime drama fare ... instantly forgettable and thoroughly dull .
2639	negative	Nothing too deep or substantial .
6649	positive	A bodice-ripper for intellectuals .
7366	neutral	Both flawed and delayed , Martin Scorcese 's Gangs of New York still emerges as his most vital work since GoodFellas .
3336	positive	Smart and taut .
5372	positive	A quasi-documentary by French filmmaker Karim Dridi that celebrates the hardy spirit of Cuban music .
7467	neutral	Though it was made with careful attention to detail and is well-acted by James Spader and Maggie Gyllenhaal , I felt disrespected .
7575	neutral	Any intellectual arguments being made about the nature of God are framed in a drama so clumsy , there is a real danger less sophisticated audiences will mistake it for an endorsement of the very things that Bean abhors .
864	negative	-LRB- A -RRB- mess .
595	positive	There is something that is so meditative and lyrical about Babak Payami 's boldly quirky Iranian drama Secret Ballot ... a charming and evoking little ditty that manages to show the gentle and humane side of Middle Eastern world politics
7649	positive	What saves it ... and makes it one of the better video-game-based flicks , is that the film acknowledges upfront that the plot makes no sense , such that the lack of linearity is the point of emotional and moral departure for protagonist Alice .
2145	positive	An ambitiously naturalistic , albeit half-baked , drama about an abused , inner-city autistic teen .
7465	negative	for those for whom the name Woody Allen was once a guarantee of something fresh , sometimes funny , and usually genuinely worthwhile , Hollywood Ending is a depressing experience
3416	positive	By its modest , straight-ahead standards , Undisputed scores a direct hit .
1013	negative	That 's muy loco , but no more ridiculous than most of the rest of `` Dragonfly . ''
4310	neutral	While Van Wilder may not be the worst National Lampoon film , it 's far from being this generation 's Animal House .
4618	positive	You 've already seen City by the Sea under a variety of titles , but it 's worth yet another visit .
3740	negative	Lyne 's latest , the erotic thriller Unfaithful , further demonstrates just how far his storytelling skills have eroded .
2282	negative	More tiring than anything .
1212	negative	Fans of Plympton 's shorts may marginally enjoy the film , but it is doubtful this listless feature will win him any new viewers .
1252	negative	` Linklater fans , or pretentious types who want to appear avant-garde will suck up to this project ... '
8339	negative	Coupling disgracefully written dialogue with flailing bodily movements that substitute for acting , Circuit is the awkwardly paced soap opera-ish story .
3252	positive	It 's a smart , solid , kinetically-charged spy flick worthy of a couple hours of summertime and a bucket of popcorn .
5105	negative	All of the elements are in place for a great film noir , but director George Hickenlooper 's approach to the material is too upbeat .
3417	positive	The most compelling performance of the year adds substantial depth to this shocking testament to anti-Semitism and neo-fascism .
4724	negative	Morrissette has performed a difficult task indeed - he 's taken one of the world 's most fascinating stories and made it dull , lifeless , and irritating .
5061	positive	A sense of real magic , perhaps .
2709	negative	You 'll find yourself wishing that you and they were in another movie .
3864	negative	Despite engaging offbeat touches , Knockaround Guys rarely seems interested in kicking around a raison d'etre that 's as fresh-faced as its young-guns cast .
52	neutral	Finally coming down off of Miramax 's deep shelves after a couple of aborted attempts , Waking Up in Reno makes a strong case for letting sleeping dogs lie .
2020	positive	Deliciously slow .
6284	neutral	This may be Dover Kosashvili 's feature directing debut , but it looks an awful lot like life -- gritty , awkward and ironic .
3687	positive	It zips along with B-movie verve while adding the rich details and go-for-broke acting that heralds something special .
3338	positive	Giggling at the absurdities and inconsistencies is part of the fun .
967	negative	There 's a whole heap of nothing at the core of this slight coming-of-age\/coming-out tale .
3631	positive	... digs beyond the usual portrayals of good kids and bad seeds to reveal a more ambivalent set of characters and motivations .
96	positive	Invigorating , surreal , and resonant with a rainbow of emotion .
3935	neutral	The talk-heavy film plays like one of Robert Altman 's lesser works .
288	positive	Its flame-like , roiling black-and-white inspires trembling and gratitude .
7341	positive	A modest masterpiece .
8300	positive	The fourth `` Pokemon '' is a diverting -- if predictable -- adventure suitable for a matinee , with a message that cautions children about disturbing the world 's delicate ecological balance .
7186	positive	-LRB- A -RRB- strong piece of work .
3268	negative	Supposedly , Pokemon ca n't be killed , but Pokemon 4Ever practically assures that the pocket monster movie franchise is nearly ready to keel over .
4222	negative	That frenetic spectacle -LRB- on the TV show -RRB- has usually been leavened by a charm that 's conspicuously missing from the Girls ' big-screen blowout .
2295	negative	Was that movie nothing more than a tepid exercise in trotting out a formula that worked five years ago but has since lost its fizz ?
7043	positive	If it 's unnerving suspense you 're after -- you 'll find it with Ring , an indisputably spooky film ; with a screenplay to die for .
4579	negative	A mess .
542	negative	The movie is too amateurishly square to make the most of its own ironic implications .
3599	negative	The colorful Masseur wastes its time on mood rather than riding with the inherent absurdity of Ganesh 's rise up the social ladder .
2096	neutral	A static and sugary little half-hour , after-school special about interfaith understanding , stretched out to 90 minutes .
2377	negative	There 's only one way to kill Michael Myers for good : stop buying tickets to these movies .
1169	positive	Sparkling , often hilarious romantic jealousy comedy ... Attal looks so much like a young Robert DeNiro that it seems the film should instead be called ` My Husband Is Travis Bickle ' .
8374	positive	Lasker 's canny , meditative script distances sex and love , as Byron and Luther ... realize they ca n't get no satisfaction without the latter .
2673	negative	If Festival in Cannes nails hard - boiled Hollywood argot with a bracingly nasty accuracy , much about the film , including some of its casting , is frustratingly unconvincing .
4244	negative	At 90 minutes this movie is short , but it feels much longer .
2938	positive	Playing a role of almost Bergmanesque intensity ... Bisset is both convincing and radiant .
6244	neutral	So earnest and well-meaning , and so stocked with talent , that you almost forget the sheer , ponderous awfulness of its script .
4373	negative	It 's only in fairy tales that princesses that are married for political reason live happily ever after .
922	negative	So devoid of pleasure or sensuality that it can not even be dubbed hedonistic .
4512	negative	A few zingers aside , the writing is indifferent , and Jordan Brady 's direction is prosaic .
4889	positive	This seductive tease of a thriller gets the job done .
7695	neutral	The film 's best trick is the way that it treats conspiracy as a kind of political Blair Witch , a monstrous murk that haunts us precisely because it can never be seen .
1577	positive	Beautifully shot against the frozen winter landscapes of Grenoble and Geneva , the film unfolds with all the mounting tension of an expert thriller , until the tragedy beneath it all gradually reveals itself .
7667	neutral	Supposedly based upon real , or at least soberly reported incidents , the film ends with a large human tragedy .
5491	negative	Reign of Fire never comes close to recovering from its demented premise , but it does sustain an enjoyable level of ridiculousness .
3248	neutral	While kids will probably eat the whole thing up , most adults will be way ahead of the plot .
8103	negative	Loud , chaotic and largely unfunny .
4128	negative	The result , however well-intentioned , is ironically just the sort of disposable , kitchen-sink homage that illustrates why the whole is so often less than the sum of its parts in today 's Hollywood .
6303	positive	Ms. Seigner and Mr. Serrault bring fresh , unforced naturalism to their characters .
2093	positive	Too daft by half ... but supremely good natured .
2179	neutral	The movie does has some entertainment value - how much depends on how well you like Chris Rock .
8126	neutral	With its hint of an awkward Hitchcockian theme in tact , Harmon 's daunting narrative promotes a reasonable landscape of conflict and pathos to support the scattershot terrorizing tone
6261	neutral	A behind the scenes look at the training and dedication that goes into becoming a world-class fencer and the champion that 's made a difference to NYC inner-city youth .
2549	positive	What redeems the film is the cast , particularly the Ya-Yas themselves .
3794	negative	The whole thing feels like a ruse , a tactic to cover up the fact that the picture is constructed around a core of flimsy -- or , worse yet , nonexistent -- ideas .
3342	negative	What might have been readily dismissed as the tiresome rant of an aging filmmaker still thumbing his nose at convention takes a surprising , subtle turn at the midway point .
2360	negative	You ca n't believe anyone would really buy this stuff .
7959	negative	If there 's a heaven for bad movies , Deuces Wild is on its way .
8305	negative	He 's not good with people .
1242	positive	A touching , small-scale story of family responsibility and care in the community .
7827	positive	Filmmakers David Weissman and Bill Weber benefit enormously from the Cockettes ' camera craziness -- not only did they film performances , but they did the same at home .
7975	negative	Pap invested in undergraduate doubling subtexts and ridiculous stabs at existentialism reminding of the discovery of the wizard of God in the fifth Trek flick .
6979	positive	Great performances , stylish cinematography and a gritty feel help make Gangster No. 1 a worthwhile moviegoing experience .
4835	positive	I had a dream that a smart comedy would come along to rescue me from a summer of teen-driven , toilet-humor codswallop , and its name was Earnest .
5755	negative	An awful lot like one of -LRB- Spears ' -RRB- music videos in content -- except that it goes on for at least 90 more minutes and , worse , that you have to pay if you want to see it .
5762	negative	Then you get another phone call warning you that if the video is n't back at Blockbuster before midnight , you 're going to face frightening late fees .
348	negative	I just saw this movie ... well , it 's probably not accurate to call it a movie .
853	positive	Affirms the gifts of all involved , starting with Spielberg and going right through the ranks of the players -- on-camera and off -- that he brings together .
2904	neutral	However stale the material , Lawrence 's delivery remains perfect ; his great gift is that he can actually trick you into thinking some of this worn-out , pandering palaver is actually funny .
2298	positive	The leaping story line , shaped by director Peter Kosminsky into sharp slivers and cutting impressions , shows all the signs of rich detail condensed into a few evocative images and striking character traits .
4306	neutral	... a fairly disposable yet still entertaining B picture .

6141	positive	And they succeed merrily at their noble endeavor .
3796	positive	You live the mood rather than savour the story .
3226	negative	High Crimes carries almost no organic intrigue as a government \/ Marine\/legal mystery , and that 's because the movie serves up all of that stuff , nearly subliminally , as the old-hat province of male intrigue .
992	positive	The film exudes the urbane sweetness that Woody Allen seems to have bitterly forsaken .
2794	positive	Even though many of these guys are less than adorable -LRB- their lamentations are pretty much self-centered -RRB- , there 's something vital about the movie .
8364	positive	In his U.S. debut , Mr. Schnitzler proves himself a deft pace master and stylist .

5029	neutral	Tells -LRB- the story -RRB- with such atmospheric ballast that shrugging off the plot 's persnickety problems is simply a matter of -LRB- being -RRB- in a shrugging mood .

3512	positive	As immaculate as Stuart Little 2 is , it could be a lot better if it were , well , more adventurous .
1919	negative	For all its shoot-outs , fistfights , and car chases , this movie is a phlegmatic bore , so tedious it makes the silly spy vs. spy film The Sum of All Fears , starring Ben Affleck , seem downright Hitchcockian .

2974	positive	Munch 's screenplay is tenderly observant of his characters .

26	neutral	It arrives with an impeccable pedigree , mongrel pep , and almost indecipherable plot complications .
2347	negative	While some will object to the idea of a Vietnam picture with such a rah-rah , patriotic tone , Soldiers ultimately achieves its main strategic objective : dramatizing the human cost of the conflict that came to define a generation .
5673	positive	The film is delicately narrated by Martin Landau and directed with sensitivity and skill by Dana Janklowicz-Mann .
2927	negative	With jump cuts , fast editing and lots of pyrotechnics , Yu clearly hopes to camouflage how bad his movie is .

2743	negative	Where 's the movie here ?
4798	neutral	With not a lot of help from the screenplay -LRB- proficient , but singularly cursory -RRB- , -LRB- Testud -RRB- acts with the feral intensity of the young Bette Davis .
7656	positive	Directing with a sure and measured hand , -LRB- Haneke -RRB- steers clear of the sensational and offers instead an unflinching and objective look at a decidedly perverse pathology .
1024	neutral	I highly recommend Irwin , but not in the way this film showcases him .

1610	positive	As quiet , patient and tenacious as Mr. Lopez himself , who approaches his difficult , endless work with remarkable serenity and discipline .
7587	neutral	The movie obviously seeks to re-create the excitement of such '50s flicks as Jules Verne 's ' 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea ' and the George Pal version of H.G. Wells ' ` The Time Machine . '
8247	positive	A sentimental but entirely irresistible portrait of three aging sisters .

1069	negative	Blue Crush is as predictable as the tides .
5464	neutral	The sight of the name Bruce Willis brings to mind images of a violent battlefield action picture , but the film has a lot more on its mind -- maybe too much .

1112	negative	Instead , it 'll only put you to sleep .
301	negative	To the filmmakers , Ivan is a prince of a fellow , but he comes across as shallow and glib though not mean-spirited , and there 's no indication that he 's been responsible for putting together any movies of particular value or merit .
3542	negative	Patchy combination of soap opera , low-tech magic realism and , at times , ploddingly sociological commentary .
7852	positive	The fun of the movie is the chance it affords to watch Jackson , who also served as executive producer , take his smooth , shrewd , powerful act abroad .
7484	positive	Told just proficiently enough to trounce its overly comfortable trappings .
7846	negative	Imagine the CleanFlicks version of ` Love Story , ' with Ali MacGraw 's profanities replaced by romance-novel platitudes .
1953	negative	Anyone else who may , for whatever reason , be thinking about going to see this movie is hereby given fair warning .
8465	negative	For those of us who respond more strongly to storytelling than computer-generated effects , the new Star Wars installment has n't escaped the rut dug by the last one .

483	positive	The moral shrapnel and mental shellshock will linger long after this film has ended .
93	negative	Entertains not so much because of its music or comic antics , but through the perverse pleasure of watching Disney scrape the bottom of its own cracker barrel .
6619	negative	If any of them list this ` credit ' on their resumes in the future , that 'll be much funnier than anything in the film ...
6780	positive	A compelling , gut-clutching piece of advocacy cinema that carries you along in a torrent of emotion as it explores the awful complications of one terrifying day .

2761	neutral	-LRB- A -RRB- stuporously solemn film .
2999	negative	The story the movie tells is of Brian De Palma 's addiction to the junk-calorie suspense tropes that have all but ruined his career .
4165	positive	We want the funk - and this movie 's got it .
3099	negative	The re - enactments , however fascinating they may be as history , are too crude to serve the work especially well .
3105	neutral	With its paint fights , motorized scooter chases and dewy-eyed sentiment

4663	positive	Skillfully weaves both the elements of the plot and a powerfully evocative mood combining heated sexuality with a haunting sense of malaise .

2222	negative	May puzzle his most ardent fans .

713	positive	Ferrara 's best film in years .
5795	negative	This is very much of a mixed bag , with enough negatives to outweigh the positives .
8007	positive	A film that begins with the everyday lives of naval personnel in San Diego and ends with scenes so true and heartbreaking that tears welled up in my eyes both times I saw the film .
1336	positive	Like many Western action films , this thriller is too loud and thoroughly overbearing , but its heartfelt concern about North Korea 's recent past and South Korea 's future adds a much needed moral weight .
4353	neutral	In trying to be daring and original , it comes off as only occasionally satirical and never fresh .
1401	positive	The performances are strong , though the subject matter demands acting that borders on hammy at times .
5216	positive	that works .
1525	neutral	Jam-packed with literally bruising jokes .

612	positive	... -LRB- the film -RRB- works , due mostly to the tongue-in-cheek attitude of the screenplay .
7451	negative	Though there are many tense scenes in Trapped , they prove more distressing than suspenseful .
3265	neutral	Whatever about warning kids about the dangers of ouija boards , someone should dispense the same advice to film directors .
2646	positive	The urban landscapes are detailed down to the signs on the kiosks , and the color palette , with lots of somber blues and pinks , is dreamy and evocative .

8315	negative	And second , what 's with all the shooting ?
3873	neutral	This slow-moving Swedish film offers not even a hint of joy , preferring to focus on the humiliation of Martin as he defecates in bed and urinates on the plants at his own birthday party .
195	neutral	Though the film never veers from its comic course , its unintentional parallels might inadvertently evoke memories and emotions which are anything but humorous .
1065	negative	A light , engaging comedy that fumbles away almost all of its accumulated enjoyment with a crucial third act miscalculation .

6679	neutral	Veers uncomfortably close to pro-Serb propaganda .

6185	positive	A hallmark film in an increasingly important film industry and worth the look .

4122	negative	The pacing is often way off and there are too many bona fide groaners among too few laughs .
2738	negative	Zellweger 's whiny pouty-lipped poof faced and spindly attempt at playing an ingenue makes her nomination as best actress even more of a an a

4202	neutral	The entire movie is filled with deja vu moments .
2770	positive	Shyamalan takes a potentially trite and overused concept -LRB- aliens come to Earth -RRB- and infuses it into a rustic , realistic , and altogether creepy tale of hidden invasion .

482	neutral	Mark Wahlberg ... may look classy in a '60s - homage pokepie hat , but as a character he 's dry , dry , dry .

6202	positive	Another entertaining romp from Robert Rodriguez .
6586	positive	I am highly amused by the idea that we have come to a point in society where it has been deemed important enough to make a film in which someone has to be hired to portray Richard Dawson .
4870	negative	One can only assume that the jury who bestowed star Hoffman 's brother Gordy with the Waldo Salt Screenwriting award at 2002 's Sundance Festival were honoring an attempt to do something different over actually pulling it off

5544	positive	The hypnotic imagery and fragmentary tale explore the connections between place and personal identity .
2197	neutral	... Ice Age treads predictably along familiar territory , making it a passable family film that wo n't win many fans over the age of 12 .
5800	negative	A film that should be relegated to a dark video store corner is somehow making its way instead to theaters .
2176	negative	Like coming into a long-running , well-written television series where you 've missed the first half-dozen episodes and probably wo n't see the next six .

3914	negative	It 's loud and boring ; watching it is like being trapped at a bad rock concert .
4525	positive	In The Pianist , Polanski is saying what he has long wanted to say , confronting the roots of his own preoccupations and obsessions , and he allows nothing to get in the way .
412	negative	Anyone who suffers through this film deserves , at the very least , a big box of consolation candy .
5927	negative	Despite its dry wit and compassion , the film suffers from a philosophical emptiness and maddeningly sedate pacing .
404	negative	Despite slick production values and director Roger Michell 's tick-tock pacing , the final effect is like having two guys yelling in your face for two hours .
1575	negative	It 's still terrible !
6177	neutral	Shamelessly resorting to pee-related sight gags that might even cause Tom Green a grimace ; still , Myer 's energy and the silliness of it all eventually prevail
8164	neutral	An empty , ugly exercise in druggy trance-noir and trumped-up street credibility .

410	neutral	Hilarious musical comedy though stymied by accents thick as mud .
97	negative	`` Analyze That '' is one of those crass , contrived sequels that not only fails on its own , but makes you second-guess your affection for the original .
5835	neutral	Dogtown and Z-Boys more than exposes the roots of the skateboarding boom that would become `` the punk kids ' revolution . ''
5316	negative	Maybe there 's a metaphor here , but figuring it out would n't make Trouble Every Day any better .
5229	positive	Interesting both as a historical study and as a tragic love story .
6075	negative	Judd 's characters ought to pick up the durable best seller Smart Women , Foolish Choices for advice .
618	negative	A tired , unnecessary retread ... a stale copy of a picture that was n't all that great to begin with .
7401	negative	Such an incomprehensible mess that it feels less like bad cinema than like being stuck in a dark pit having a nightmare about bad cinema .
7405	neutral	It 's up to you to decide whether to admire these people 's dedication to their cause or be repelled by their dogmatism , manipulativeness and narrow , fearful view of American life .
7131	negative	The attempt to build up a pressure cooker of horrified awe emerges from the simple fact that the movie has virtually nothing to show .
7871	negative	An unremittingly ugly movie to look at , listen to , and think about , it is quite possibly the sturdiest example yet of why the DV revolution has cheapened the artistry of making a film .

7559	neutral	The movie is gorgeously made , but it is also somewhat shallow and art-conscious .
5954	neutral	The performances are all solid ; it merely lacks originality to make it a great movie .
6737	neutral	This engrossing , characteristically complex Tom Clancy thriller is shifty in the manner in which it addresses current terrorism anxieties and sidesteps them at the same time .
3659	positive	Apart from anything else , this is one of the best-sustained ideas I have ever seen on the screen .
4922	negative	Not even Steven Spielberg has dreamed up such blatant and sickening product placement in a movie .

7588	positive	There 's so much to look at in Metropolis you hate to tear your eyes away from the images long enough to read the subtitles .
4756	negative	Flashy gadgets and whirling fight sequences may look cool , but they ca n't distract from the flawed support structure holding Equilibrium up .
4017	positive	It 's enough to watch Huppert scheming , with her small , intelligent eyes as steady as any noir villain , and to enjoy the perfectly pitched web of tension that Chabrol spins .
8516	positive	Williams creates a stunning , Taxi Driver-esque portrayal of a man teetering on the edge of sanity .
5324	positive	Mazel tov to a film about a family 's joyous life acting on the Yiddish stage .

2982	positive	There 's a lot to recommend Read My Lips .
3593	positive	Works as pretty contagious fun .

4135	negative	Degenerates into hogwash .

1855	positive	Meticulously mounted , exasperatingly well-behaved film , which ticks off Kahlo 's lifetime milestones with the dutiful precision of a tax accountant .
7334	positive	Tully is in many ways the perfect festival film : a calm , self-assured portrait of small town regret , love , duty and friendship that appeals to the storytelling instincts of a slightly more literate filmgoing audience .
6924	neutral	A bonanza of wacky sight gags , outlandish color schemes , and corny visual puns that can be appreciated equally as an abstract Frank Tashlin comedy and as a playful recapitulation of the artist 's career .
3558	negative	What makes Esther Kahn so demanding is that it progresses in such a low-key manner that it risks monotony .
2716	negative	A film that loses sight of its own story .
813	neutral	An ambitious and moving but bleak film .
2853	positive	Assured , vital and well wrought , the film is , arguably , the most accomplished work to date from Hong Kong 's versatile Stanley Kwan .

5897	positive	An entertaining British hybrid of comedy , caper thrills and quirky romance .
2286	negative	Cassavetes thinks he 's making Dog Day Afternoon with a cause , but all he 's done is to reduce everything he touches to a shrill , didactic cartoon .

4273	neutral	The movie has generic virtues , and despite a lot of involved talent , seems done by the numbers .
6079	negative	The script is too mainstream and the psychology too textbook to intrigue .
7784	negative	It 's a feel-bad ending for a depressing story that throws a bunch of hot-button items in the viewer 's face and asks to be seen as hip , winking social commentary .
1873	neutral	One of those staggeringly well-produced , joylessly extravagant pictures that keep whooshing you from one visual marvel to the next , hastily , emptily .
4242	positive	While Bollywood\/Hollywood will undoubtedly provide its keenest pleasures to those familiar with Bombay musicals , it also has plenty for those -LRB- like me -RRB- who are n't .

6610	negative	This director 's cut -- which adds 51 minutes -- takes a great film and turns it into a mundane soap opera .
1579	positive	Oddly compelling .
5768	neutral	The farcical elements seemed too pat and familiar to hold my interest , yet its diverting grim message is a good one .

5151	negative	Her fans walked out muttering words like `` horrible '' and `` terrible , '' but had so much fun dissing the film that they did n't mind the ticket cost .
6321	neutral	If Deuces Wild had been tweaked up a notch it would have become a camp adventure , one of those movies that 's so bad it starts to become good .

5345	positive	What makes the movie special is its utter sincerity .

380	positive	Nicely combines the enigmatic features of ` Memento ' with the hallucinatory drug culture of ` Requiem for a Dream . '
2270	positive	A fascinating case study of flower-power liberation -- and the price that was paid for it .
8023	neutral	Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is deja vu all over again , and while that is a cliche , nothing could be more appropriate .
4251	neutral	Culkin turns his character into what is basically an anti-Harry Potter -- right down to the Gryffindor scarf .
1903	negative	More dutiful than enchanting ... terribly episodic and lacking the spark of imagination that might have made it an exhilarating treat .
5412	positive	It 's always fascinating to watch Marker the essayist at work .
2782	negative	I do n't think so .
4940	neutral	The ending does n't work ... but most of the movie works so well I 'm almost recommending it , anyway -- maybe not to everybody , but certainly to people with a curiosity about how a movie can go very right , and then step wrong .

6467	neutral	Though the opera itself takes place mostly indoors , Jacquot seems unsure of how to evoke any sort of naturalism on the set .
5177	negative	It 's possible that something hip and transgressive was being attempted here that stubbornly refused to gel , but the result is more puzzling than unsettling .
7345	negative	Any rock pile will do for a set .
7364	negative	This picture is murder by numbers , and as easy to be bored by as your ABC 's , despite a few whopping shootouts .
4105	positive	Plus , like I already mentioned ... it 's Robert Duvall !
4148	neutral	A frustrating yet deeply watchable melodrama that makes you think it 's a tougher picture than it is .
4110	positive	-LRB- A -RRB- thoughtful , visually graceful work .
5421	neutral	A pint-sized ` Goodfellas ' designed to appeal to the younger set , it 's not a very good movie in any objective sense , but it does mostly hold one 's interest .
7205	neutral	The cameo-packed , M : I-2-spoofing title sequence is the funniest 5 minutes to date in this spy comedy franchise ... Then Mike Myers shows up and ruins everything .
4953	positive	The wonderfully lush Morvern Callar is pure punk existentialism , and Ms. Ramsay and her co-writer , Liana Dognini , have dramatized the Alan Warner novel , which itself felt like an answer to Irvine Welsh 's book Trainspotting .
2533	negative	The movie fails to portray its literarily talented and notorious subject as anything much more than a dirty old man .
1184	neutral	More than simply a portrait of early extreme sports , this peek into the 1970s skateboard revolution is a skateboard film as social anthropology ...
8241	positive	-LRB- Allen -RRB- manages to breathe life into this somewhat tired premise .
4708	negative	The locale ... remains far more interesting than the story at hand .
3994	positive	`` Cremaster 3 '' should come with the warning `` For serious film buffs only ! ''

1092	negative	... this story gets sillier , not scarier , as it goes along ...
7937	neutral	Well-meaning but inert .
1051	negative	To the vast majority of more casual filmgoers , it will probably be a talky bore .
141	negative	Poor editing , bad bluescreen , and ultra-cheesy dialogue highlight the radical action .
6425	positive	As they used to say in the 1950s sci-fi movies , Signs is a tribute to Shyamalan 's gifts , which are such that we 'll keep watching the skies for his next project .
8438	positive	A wonderfully speculative character study that made up for its rather slow beginning by drawing me into the picture .
3257	negative	But the movie that does n't really deliver for country music fans or for family audiences
2310	positive	Murderous Maids pulls no punches in its depiction of the lives of the Papin sister and the events that led to their notorious rise to infamy ...
3408	negative	-LRB- Janey -RRB- forgets about her other obligations , leading to a tragedy which is somehow guessable from the first few minutes , maybe because it echoes the by now intolerable morbidity of so many recent movies .
761	neutral	The movie is obviously a labour of love so Howard appears to have had free rein to be as pretentious as he wanted .
3430	negative	Those 24-and-unders looking for their own Caddyshack to adopt as a generational signpost may have to keep on looking .
5184	positive	Some Body will take you places you have n't been , and also places you have .

6118	negative	Instead of building to a laugh riot we are left with a handful of disparate funny moments of no real consequence .
3421	negative	Hard-core slasher aficionados will find things to like ... but overall the Halloween series has lost its edge .
1798	positive	Becomes a fascinating study of isolation and frustration that successfully recreates both the physical setting and emotional tensions of the Papin sisters .
6355	negative	A feeble Tootsie knockoff .
2518	neutral	Has not so much been written as assembled , Frankenstein-like , out of other , marginally better shoot-em-ups .
4194	neutral	The movie certainly has its share of clever moments and biting dialogue , but there 's just not much lurking below its abstract surface .
3854	neutral	Though not for everyone , The Guys is a somber trip worth taking .

5393	neutral	The boys ' sparring , like the succession of blows dumped on Guei , wears down the story 's more cerebral , and likable , plot elements .

3765	positive	It 's dark but has wonderfully funny moments ; you care about the characters ; and the action and special effects are first-rate .
4520	neutral	If there 's one big point to Promises , it 's that nothing can change while physical and psychological barriers keep the sides from speaking even one word to each other .
8419	negative	Cheap , vulgar dialogue and a plot that crawls along at a snail 's pace .
625	neutral	Better than the tepid Star Trek : Insurrection ; falls short of First Contact because the villain could n't pick the lint off Borg Queen Alice Krige 's cape ; and finishes half a parsec -LRB- a nose -RRB- ahead of Generations .
4853	negative	The problem is that Van Wilder does little that is actually funny with the material .
7532	neutral	A few energetic stunt sequences briefly enliven the film , but the wheezing terrorist subplot has n't the stamina for the 100-minute running time , and the protagonists ' bohemian boorishness mars the spirit of good clean fun .
3340	positive	Symbolically , Warm Water Under a Red Bridge is a celebration of feminine energy , a tribute to the power of women to heal .
6194	positive	This is a film that manages to find greatness in the hue of its drastic iconography .
2765	positive	The fact is that the screen is most alive when it seems most likely that Broomfield 's interviewees , or even himself , will not be for much longer .
7143	positive	A formula family tearjerker told with a heavy Irish brogue ... accentuating , rather than muting , the plot 's saccharine thrust .
1147	positive	The rare Imax movie that you 'll wish was longer than an hour .
3588	negative	See Clockstoppers if you have nothing better to do with 94 minutes .
1322	negative	You can taste it , but there 's no fizz .
6646	negative	It 's like Rocky and Bullwinkle on Speed , but that 's neither completely enlightening , nor does it catch the intensity of the movie 's strangeness .
6090	negative	It 's Tommy 's job to clean the peep booths surrounding her , and after viewing this one , you 'll feel like mopping up , too .
7506	positive	`` Simone '' is a fun and funky look into an artificial creation in a world that thrives on artificiality .

7452	positive	... works on some levels and is certainly worth seeing at least once .
6454	positive	Children and adults enamored of all things Pokemon wo n't be disappointed .

4474	negative	When it comes to the battle of Hollywood vs. Woo , it looks like Woo 's a P.O.W.
4573	positive	Whereas Oliver Stone 's conspiracy thriller JFK was long , intricate , star-studded and visually flashy , Interview with the Assassin draws its considerable power from simplicity .
6735	positive	Anyone who ever fantasized about space travel but ca n't afford the $ 20 million ticket to ride a Russian rocket should catch this IMAX offering .

7424	neutral	The film 's overall mood and focus is interesting but constantly unfulfilling .

6463	negative	... the film 's considered approach to its subject matter is too calm and thoughtful for agitprop , and the thinness of its characterizations makes it a failure as straight drama . '
4971	neutral	In a strange way , Egoyan has done too much .
4219	neutral	It is a challenging film , if not always a narratively cohesive one .
6588	neutral	An average coming-of-age tale elevated by the wholesome twist of a pesky mother interfering during her son 's discovery of his homosexuality .

823	negative	Comes across as a fairly weak retooling .
1370	positive	The lively appeal of The Last Kiss lies in the ease with which it integrates thoughtfulness and pasta-fagioli comedy .
1623	negative	... grows decidedly flimsier with its many out-sized , out of character and logically porous action set pieces .
5136	neutral	Meant to reduce Blake 's philosophy into a tragic coming-of-age saga punctuated by bursts of animator Todd McFarlane 's superhero dystopia .
1073	positive	A compelling coming-of-age drama about the arduous journey of a sensitive young girl through a series of foster homes and a fierce struggle to pull free from her dangerous and domineering mother 's hold over her .
7103	positive	Often likable , but just as often it 's meandering , low on energy , and too eager to be quirky at moments when a little old-fashioned storytelling would come in handy .
1407	positive	Like a skillful fisher , the director uses the last act to reel in the audience since its poignancy hooks us completely .
5245	neutral	It 's not particularly subtle ... However , it still manages to build to a terrifying , if obvious , conclusion .
7065	neutral	And I expect much more from a talent as outstanding as director Bruce McCulloch .
5481	positive	A must-see for fans of thoughtful war films and those interested in the sights and sounds of battle .
473	positive	A heartening tale of small victories and enduring hope .
3000	positive	But the nerve-raked acting , the crackle of lines , the impressive stagings of hardware , make for some robust and scary entertainment .
4790	negative	A movie that ca n't get sufficient distance from Leroy 's delusions to escape their maudlin influence .
6472	positive	Though Lan Yu lacks a sense of dramatic urgency , the film makes up for it with a pleasing verisimilitude .

1794	negative	... a bland , pretentious mess .

3284	negative	Even if it is generally amusing from time to time , I Spy has all the same problems the majority of action comedies have .
282	negative	First , for a movie that tries to be smart , it 's kinda dumb .
1362	positive	Formuliac , but fun .
1745	positive	Like the original , this version is raised a few notches above kiddie fantasy pablum by Allen 's astringent wit .
3402	negative	Like the Tuck family themselves , this movie just goes on and on and on and on
2891	negative	Problem is , we have no idea what in creation is going on .
3382	neutral	Calculated swill .
5222	negative	Donovan ... squanders his main asset , Jackie Chan , and fumbles the vital action sequences .
419	negative	Attal pushes too hard to make this a comedy or serious drama .
763	positive	Fessenden 's narrative is just as much about the ownership and redefinition of myth as it is about a domestic unit finding their way to joy .
1608	neutral	The impulses that produced this project ... are commendable , but the results are uneven .
297	positive	While maintaining the appearance of clinical objectivity , this sad , occasionally horrifying but often inspiring film is among Wiseman 's warmest .

7242	negative	I can imagine this movie as a b & w British comedy , circa 1960 , with Peter Sellers , Kenneth Williams , et al. , but at this time , with this cast , this movie is hopeless .
5605	negative	The film falls short on tension , eloquence , spiritual challenge -- things that have made the original New Testament stories so compelling for 20 centuries .
4567	positive	Deliberately and devotedly constructed , Far from Heaven is too picture postcard perfect , too neat and new pin-like , too obviously a recreation to resonate .
3300	negative	... while Dark Water is n't a complete wash -LRB- no pun intended -RRB- , watched side-by-side with Ringu , it ultimately comes off as a pale successor .
2032	neutral	Nachtwey clears the cynicism right out of you .
1552	neutral	Wait for pay per view or rental but do n't dismiss BarberShop out of hand .
4264	positive	Writer-director David Jacobson and his star , Jeremy Renner , have made a remarkable film that explores the monster 's psychology not in order to excuse him but rather to demonstrate that his pathology evolved from human impulses that grew hideously twisted .
2819	negative	A full-frontal attack on audience patience .
4241	negative	Bread , My Sweet has so many flaws it would be easy for critics to shred it .
2371	positive	Cineasts will revel in those visual in-jokes , as in the film 's verbal pokes at everything from the likes of Miramax chief Harvey Weinstein 's bluff personal style to the stylistic rigors of Denmark 's Dogma movement .
7519	negative	A muted freak-out
6442	positive	... in no way original , or even all that memorable , but as downtown Saturday matinee brain candy , it does n't disappoint .
8485	positive	Visually , ` Santa Clause 2 ' is wondrously creative .
6110	negative	Not once does it come close to being exciting .
447	neutral	The directive to protect the code at all costs also begins to blur as the importance of the man and the code merge
7258	neutral	Less a heartfelt appeal for the handicapped than a nice Belgian waffle .
1211	positive	Astonishing ... -LRB- frames -RRB- profound ethical and philosophical questions in the form of dazzling pop entertainment .
5445	negative	The screenwriters dig themselves in deeper every time they toss logic and science into what is essentially a `` Dungeons and Dragons '' fantasy with modern military weaponry ...
2292	positive	Easily one of the best and most exciting movies of the year .
7584	positive	Literary purists may not be pleased , but as far as mainstream matinee-style entertainment goes , it does a bang-up job of pleasing the crowds .
4528	positive	Some Body is a shaky , uncertain film that nevertheless touches a few raw nerves .
4398	negative	I found it slow , predictable and not very amusing .
5784	negative	Hart 's War seems to want to be a character study , but apparently ca n't quite decide which character .
3124	negative	The picture seems uncertain whether it wants to be an acidic all-male All About Eve or a lush , swooning melodrama in the Intermezzo strain .
4486	positive	delightfully rendered
6887	neutral	The question hanging over The Time Machine is not , as the main character suggests , ` what if ? '
3229	negative	The ethos of the Chelsea Hotel may shape Hawke 's artistic aspirations , but he has n't yet coordinated his own DV poetry with the Beat he hears in his soul .
4181	positive	Duvall is strong as always .
934	neutral	The umpteenth summer skinny dip in Jerry Bruckheimer 's putrid pond of retread action twaddle .
6993	positive	Neither quite a comedy nor a romance , more of an impish divertissement of themes that interest Attal and Gainsbourg -- they live together -- the film has a lot of charm .
7448	positive	Spiderman ROCKS
411	negative	A movie like The Guys is why film criticism can be considered work .
6427	negative	A technical triumph and an extraordinary bore .
1980	positive	An enjoyable above average summer diversion .
5657	positive	Yes , it 's as good as you remember .
162	positive	It 's the filmmakers ' post-camp comprehension of what made old-time B movies good-bad that makes Eight Legged Freaks a perfectly entertaining summer diversion .
230	neutral	Or both .
6035	negative	I approached the usher and said that if she had to sit through it again , she should ask for a raise .
7082	positive	A mostly believable , refreshingly low-key and quietly inspirational little sports drama .
8229	positive	It 's immensely ambitious , different than anything that 's been done before and amazingly successful in terms of what it 's trying to do .
4945	positive	There are n't many conclusive answers in the film , but there is an interesting story of pointed personalities , courage , tragedy and the little guys vs. the big guys .
1735	positive	You can watch , giggle and get an adrenaline boost without feeling like you 've completely lowered your entertainment standards .
120	positive	Mr. Polanski is in his element here : alone , abandoned , but still consoled by his art , which is more than he has ever revealed before about the source of his spiritual survival .
5070	negative	A high-minded snoozer .
5140	negative	A bore that tends to hammer home every one of its points .
3334	positive	The movie 's captivating details are all in the performances , from Foreman 's barking-mad Taylor to Thewlis 's smoothly sinister Freddie and Bettany\/McDowell 's hard-eyed gangster .
3824	negative	What more can be expected from a college comedy that 's target audience has n't graduated from junior high school ?

5728	neutral	Bacon keeps things interesting , but do n't go out of your way to pay full price .
714	neutral	Possibly not since Grumpy Old Men have I heard a film so solidly connect with one demographic while striking out with another .
884	positive	Godard has never made a more sheerly beautiful film than this unexpectedly moving meditation on love , history , memory , resistance and artistic transcendence .
8304	negative	Journalistically dubious , inept and often lethally dull .
6101	neutral	Nair does n't use -LRB- Monsoon Wedding -RRB- to lament the loss of culture .
8398	negative	The material and the production itself are little more than routine .
510	neutral	Newcomer helmer Kevin Donovan is hamstrung by a badly handled screenplay of what is really an amusing concept -- a high-tech tux that transforms its wearer into a superman .

8160	positive	First-time writer-director Dylan Kidd also has a good ear for dialogue , and the characters sound like real people .
3703	negative	A boring , pretentious muddle that uses a sensational , real-life 19th-Century crime as a metaphor for -- well , I 'm not exactly sure what -- and has all the dramatic weight of a raindrop .
1805	positive	She 's as rude and profane as ever , always hilarious and , most of the time , absolutely right in her stinging social observations .
2121	negative	One of those films where the characters inhabit that special annex of hell where adults behave like kids , children behave like adults and everyone screams at the top of their lungs no matter what the situation .
860	neutral	It will break your heart many times over .
607	neutral	But I do .
5624	negative	The abiding impression , despite the mild hallucinogenic buzz , is of overwhelming waste -- the acres of haute couture ca n't quite conceal that there 's nothing resembling a spine here .
4275	negative	Stripped almost entirely of such tools as nudity , profanity and violence , LaBute does manage to make a few points about modern man and his problematic quest for human connection .
5550	positive	The enjoyable Undercover Brother , a zany mix of Saturday Night Live-style parody , '70s Blaxploitation films and goofball action comedy gone wild , dishes out a ton of laughs that everyone can enjoy .
4217	neutral	The movie ultimately relies a bit too heavily on grandstanding , emotional , Rocky-like moments ... but it 's such a warm and charming package that you 'll feel too happy to argue much .
8268	positive	The film 's plot may be shallow , but you 've never seen the deep like you see it in these harrowing surf shots .

544	positive	The film 's constant mood of melancholy and its unhurried narrative are masterfully controlled .
4509	positive	As dumb and cheesy as they may be , the cartoons look almost Shakespearean -- both in depth and breadth -- after watching this digital-effects-heavy , supposed family-friendly comedy .
7306	positive	It 's a very valuable film ...

1877	positive	The emotion is impressively true for being so hot-blooded , and both leads are up to the task .
5028	negative	This picture is mostly a lump of run-of-the-mill profanity sprinkled with a few remarks so geared toward engendering audience sympathy that you might think he was running for office -- or trying to win over a probation officer .
8387	negative	Director Tom Shadyac and star Kevin Costner glumly mishandle the story 's promising premise of a physician who needs to heal himself .
7501	neutral	As well-acted and well-intentioned as All or Nothing is , however , the film comes perilously close to being too bleak , too pessimistic and too unflinching for its own good .
847	negative	This movie is about the worst thing Chan has done in the United States .
7201	neutral	Parker should be commended for taking a fresh approach to familiar material , but his determination to remain true to the original text leads him to adopt a somewhat mannered tone ... that ultimately dulls the human tragedy at the story 's core .

5012	negative	A movie that 's held captive by mediocrity .
3412	positive	While the story does seem pretty unbelievable at times , it 's awfully entertaining to watch .

7857	positive	`` Frailty '' has been written so well , that even a simple `` Goddammit ! ''

5702	neutral	Do n't expect any subtlety from this latest entry in the increasingly threadbare gross-out comedy cycle .
2358	negative	No , I do n't know why Steven Seagal is considered a star , nor why he keeps being cast in action films when none of them are ever any good or make any money .
6459	negative	It looks good , but it is essentially empty .
8245	positive	While general audiences might not come away with a greater knowledge of the facts of Cuban music , they 'll be treated to an impressive and highly entertaining celebration of its sounds .
2959	neutral	Earnest but heavy-handed .
4799	positive	Cletis is playful but highly studied and dependent for its success on a patient viewer .
149	neutral	Because Eight Legged Freaks is partly an homage to Them , Tarantula and other low - budget B-movie thrillers of the 1950s and '60s , the movie is a silly -LRB- but not sophomoric -RRB- romp through horror and hellish conditions .

680	positive	The heart of the film is a touching reflection on aging , suffering and the prospect of death .
4740	positive	A damn fine and a truly distinctive and a deeply pertinent film .
7438	positive	The plot of the comeback curlers is n't very interesting actually , but what I like about Men With Brooms and what is kind of special is how the film knows what 's unique and quirky about Canadians .
7891	positive	Death to Smoochy is often very funny , but what 's even more remarkable is the integrity of DeVito 's misanthropic vision .
876	negative	The movie would seem less of a trifle if Ms. Sugarman followed through on her defiance of the saccharine .
2627	negative	From its nauseating spinning credits sequence to a very talented but underutilized supporting cast , Bartleby squanders as much as it gives out .
1338	positive	It 's got all the familiar Bruckheimer elements , and Schumacher does probably as good a job as anyone at bringing off the Hopkins\/Rock collision of acting styles and onscreen personas .
8195	neutral	There are many things that solid acting can do for a movie , but crafting something promising from a mediocre screenplay is not one of them .
2472	neutral	A glorious mess .
7624	positive	Like The English Patient and The Unbearable Lightness of Being , The Hours is one of those reputedly `` unfilmable '' novels that has bucked the odds to emerge as an exquisite motion picture in its own right .
8343	positive	Has its moments -- and almost as many subplots .
3654	negative	Less funny than it should be and less funny than it thinks it is .
6096	negative	The redeeming feature of Chan 's films has always been the action , but the stunts in The Tuxedo seem tired and , what 's worse , routine .
3446	negative	Like a grinning Jack O ' Lantern , its apparent glee is derived from a lobotomy , having had all its vital essence scooped out and discarded .
3961	positive	Polanski has found the perfect material with which to address his own World War II experience in his signature style .
455	neutral	Maelstrom is a deliberately unsteady mixture of stylistic elements .
8452	positive	Nolan proves that he can cross swords with the best of them and helm a more traditionally plotted popcorn thriller while surrendering little of his intellectual rigor or creative composure .
1663	negative	The big finish is a bit like getting all excited about a chocolate eclair and then biting into it and finding the filling missing .
4895	neutral	` Like a child with an important message to tell ... -LRB- Skins ' -RRB- faults are easy to forgive because the intentions are lofty . '
849	positive	From blushing to gushing -- Imamura squirts the screen in ` Warm Water Under a Red Bridge '
7234	positive	a screenplay more ingeniously constructed than `` Memento ''
4566	positive	It 's unlikely we 'll see a better thriller this year .
2183	negative	A series of immaculately composed shots of Patch Adams quietly freaking out does not make for much of a movie .
6258	positive	A properly spooky film about the power of spirits to influence us whether we believe in them or not .
5066	positive	A heady , biting , be-bop ride through nighttime Manhattan , a loquacious videologue of the modern male and the lengths to which he 'll go to weave a protective cocoon around his own ego .
3891	positive	By the end of it all I sort of loved the people onscreen , even though I could not stand them .
3190	positive	For proof of that on the cinematic front , look no further than this 20th anniversary edition of the film that Spielberg calls , retrospectively , his most personal work yet .
4530	positive	Rarely , a movie is more than a movie .
6109	negative	... most viewers will wish there had been more of the `` Queen '' and less of the `` Damned . ''
3801	negative	One of the more glaring signs of this movie 's servitude to its superstar is the way it skirts around any scenes that might have required genuine acting from Ms. Spears .
8088	positive	The best thing about the movie is its personable , amusing cast .
6872	negative	Looks and feels like a low-budget hybrid of Scarface or Carlito 's Way .
4860	negative	He thinks the film is just as much a document about him as it is about the subject .
5072	negative	A little less extreme than in the past , with longer exposition sequences between them , and with fewer gags to break the tedium .
6401	negative	Certain to be distasteful to children and adults alike , Eight Crazy Nights is a total misfire .
1377	positive	The power of Shanghai Ghetto , a documentary by Dana Janklowicz-Mann and Amir Mann , rests in the voices of men and women , now in their 70s , who lived there in the 1940s .
1523	positive	The Pianist -LRB- is -RRB- a supremely hopeful cautionary tale of war 's madness remembered that we , today , can prevent its tragic waste of life .
4440	positive	Crudup 's screen presence is the one thing that holds interest in the midst of a mushy , existential exploration of why men leave their families .

3726	positive	-LRB- F -RRB- rom the performances and the cinematography to the outstanding soundtrack and unconventional narrative , the film is blazingly alive and admirable on many levels .
5655	positive	` Alice 's adventure through the looking glass and into zombie-land ' is filled with strange and wonderful creatures .
1692	negative	The worst film of the year .
5964	neutral	The niftiest trick perpetrated by The Importance of Being Earnest is the alchemical transmogrification of Wilde into Austen -- and a Hollywood-ized Austen at that .
1209	positive	A moving and stark reminder that the casualties of war reach much further than we imagine .
4023	negative	It 's clotted with heavy-handed symbolism , dime-store psychology and endless scenic shots that make 105 minutes seem twice as long .
4757	positive	Able to provide insight into a fascinating part of theater history .
3686	positive	The concept behind Kung Pow : Enter the Fist is hilarious .
6078	neutral	, Skins has its heart in the right place
3894	positive	... Wallace is smart to vary the pitch of his movie , balancing deafening battle scenes with quieter domestic scenes of women back home receiving War Department telegrams .
7397	neutral	That is made almost impossible by events that set the plot in motion .
4356	negative	The April 2002 instalment of the American War for Independence , complete with loads of CGI and bushels of violence , but not a drop of human blood .
7392	negative	Broomfield 's style of journalism is hardly journalism at all , and even those with an avid interest in the subject will grow impatient .
5037	negative	But what is missing from it all is a moral .
2543	negative	A dark comedy that goes for sick and demented humor simply to do so .
6384	positive	Alas , it 's the man that makes the clothes .
4192	negative	It 's not only dull because we 've seen -LRB- Eddie -RRB- Murphy do the genial-rogue shtick to death , but because the plot is equally hackneyed .
7180	negative	Feels less like a cousin to Blade Runner than like a bottom-feeder sequel in the Escape From New York series .
7339	negative	Excruciatingly unfunny and pitifully unromantic .
1628	negative	Apparently reassembled from the cutting-room floor of any given daytime soap .
7761	positive	Laced with liberal doses of dark humor , gorgeous exterior photography , and a stable-full of solid performances , No Such Thing is a fascinating little tale .
3921	neutral	Viewing this underdramatized but overstated film is like watching a transcript of a therapy session brought to humdrum life by some Freudian puppet .
8453	positive	Maybe not a classic , but a movie the kids will want to see over and over again .
183	positive	Evokes the style and flash of the double-cross that made Mamet 's `` House of Games '' and last fall 's `` Heist '' so much fun .
7933	neutral	It may not be history -- but then again , what if it is ?
1936	positive	-LRB- Gulpilil -RRB- is a commanding screen presence , and his character 's abundant humanism makes him the film 's moral compass .
4696	negative	Bears about as much resemblance to the experiences of most battered women as Spider-Man does to the experiences of most teenagers .
7855	negative	Stale , futile scenario .

2387	negative	Swiftly deteriorates into a terribly obvious melodrama and rough-hewn vanity project for lead actress Andie MacDowell .
5972	negative	There is something in Full Frontal , I guess , about artifice and acting and how it distorts reality for people who make movies and watch them , but like most movie riddles , it works only if you have an interest in the characters you see .

4979	positive	Catch it ... if you can !
2413	neutral	Seeing Seinfeld at home as he watches his own appearance on Letterman with a clinical eye reminds you that the key to stand-up is to always make it look easy , even though the reality is anything but .

1789	positive	And Vin Diesel is the man .
2807	negative	This is not an easy film .
7578	positive	From the dull , surreal ache of mortal awareness emerges a radiant character portrait .
4291	positive	The irony is that this film 's cast is uniformly superb ; their performances could have -- should have -- been allowed to stand on their own .
1963	negative	A gushy episode of `` M \* A \* S \* H '' only this time from an Asian perspective .
5411	positive	Sayles has an eye for the ways people of different ethnicities talk to and about others outside the group .
5300	neutral	It 's been made with an innocent yet fervid conviction that our Hollywood has all but lost .
6521	positive	Though it 's equally solipsistic in tone , the movie has enough vitality to justify the notion of creating a screen adaptation of Evans ' saga of Hollywood excess .
8386	negative	By the time the plot grinds itself out in increasingly incoherent fashion , you might be wishing for a watch that makes time go faster rather than the other way around .
1540	negative	An ugly , revolting movie .
6801	positive	The first five minutes will have you talking 'til the end of the year !
3244	positive	The charm of Revolution OS is rather the way it introduces you to new , fervently held ideas and fanciful thinkers .
1844	negative	Tykwer 's surface flash is n't just a poor fit with Kieslowski 's lyrical pessimism ; it completely contradicts everything Kieslowski 's work aspired to , including the condition of art .
3066	negative	-LRB- T -RRB- he script is n't up to the level of the direction , nor are the uneven performances by the cast members , who seem bound and determined to duplicate Bela Lugosi 's now-cliched vampire accent .
351	neutral	If the idea of the white man arriving on foreign shores to show wary natives the true light is abhorrent to you , the simplistic Heaven will quite likely be more like hell .
420	negative	plays like some corny television production from a bygone era
3813	neutral	Hardly a nuanced portrait of a young woman 's breakdown , the film nevertheless works up a few scares .
7765	negative	Schneidermeister ... Makin ' a fool of himself ... Losin ' his fan base ...
6385	positive	As Janice , Eileen Walsh , an engaging , wide-eyed actress whose teeth are a little too big for her mouth , infuses the movie with much of its slender , glinting charm .
949	positive	I was amused and entertained by the unfolding of Bielinsky 's cleverly constructed scenario , and greatly impressed by the skill of the actors involved in the enterprise .
1854	positive	That the real Antwone Fisher was able to overcome his personal obstacles and become a good man is a wonderful thing ; that he has been able to share his story so compellingly with us is a minor miracle .
5977	positive	A fresh-faced , big-hearted and frequently funny thrill ride for the kiddies , with enough eye candy and cheeky wit to keep parents away from the concession stand . '
5950	positive	So fiendishly cunning that even the most jaded cinema audiences will leave the auditorium feeling dizzy , confused , and totally disorientated .
6630	negative	Do n't say you were n't warned .
6407	negative	Exhibits the shallow sensationalism characteristic of soap opera ... more salacious telenovela than serious drama .
842	negative	After all , he took three minutes of dialogue , 30 seconds of plot and turned them into a 90-minute movie that feels five hours long .
2324	positive	There 's just something about watching a squad of psychopathic underdogs whale the tar out of unsuspecting lawmen that reaches across time and distance .
4793	neutral	It has the right approach and the right opening premise , but it lacks the zest and it goes for a plot twist instead of trusting the material .
4526	negative	I felt trapped and with no obvious escape for the entire 100 minutes .
8311	positive	An eye-boggling blend of psychedelic devices , special effects and backgrounds , ` Spy Kids 2 ' is a visual treat for all audiences .
2352	positive	It 's funny .
1807	positive	It may not be particularly innovative , but the film 's crisp , unaffected style and air of gentle longing make it unexpectedly rewarding .
3831	negative	Lazy filmmaking , with the director taking a hands-off approach when he should have shaped the story to show us why it 's compelling .
2153	negative	Just about all of the film is confusing on one level or another , making Ararat far more demanding than it needs to be .
5517	negative	` It looks good , Sonny , but you missed the point . '
4267	positive	This makes Minority Report necessary viewing for sci-fi fans , as the film has some of the best special effects ever .
4897	negative	When your subject is illusion versus reality , should n't the reality seem at least passably real ?
3201	negative	A movie version of a paint-by-numbers picture .
2069	positive	A charmer from Belgium .
4343	positive	Fontaine masterfully creates a portrait of two strong men in conflict , inextricably entwined through family history , each seeing himself in the other , neither liking what he sees .
3835	negative	The story is -- forgive me -- a little thin , and the filmmaking clumsy and rushed .
5310	neutral	What it lacks in originality it makes up for in effective if cheap moments of fright and dread .
1704	positive	It has that rare quality of being able to creep the living hell out of you ...
4090	positive	The film is darkly funny in its observation of just how much more grueling and time-consuming the illusion of work is than actual work .
2269	positive	In a movie full of surprises , the biggest is that Secret Ballot is a comedy , both gentle and biting .
1916	positive	A full experience , a love story and a murder mystery that expands into a meditation on the deep deceptions of innocence .
1093	neutral	You can thank me for this .
5520	positive	Cold , nervy and memorable .
5496	positive	Toes the fine line between cheese and earnestness remarkably well ; everything is delivered with such conviction that it 's hard not to be carried away .
1553	neutral	All very stylish and beautifully photographed , but far more trouble than it 's worth , with fantasy mixing with reality and actors playing more than one role just to add to the confusion .
7747	negative	In old-fashioned screenwriting parlance , Ms. Shreve 's novel proved too difficult a text to ` lick , ' despite the efforts of a first-rate cast .
6122	positive	Kids five and up will be delighted with the fast , funny , and even touching story .
2587	positive	The overall fabric is hypnotic , and Mr. Mattei fosters moments of spontaneous intimacy .
66	negative	Downright transparent is the script 's endless assault of embarrassingly ham-fisted sex jokes that reek of a script rewrite designed to garner the film a `` cooler '' PG-13 rating .
3818	positive	A beautiful paean to a time long past .
3630	positive	Worth a look by those on both sides of the issues , if only for the perspective it offers , one the public rarely sees .
2400	positive	The usual movie rah-rah , pleasantly and predictably delivered in low-key style by director Michael Apted and writer Tom Stoppard .
1645	negative	Kicks off with an inauspicious premise , mopes through a dreary tract of virtually plotless meanderings and then ends with a whimper .
3318	negative	Ringu is a disaster of a story , full of holes and completely lacking in chills .
2405	negative	By-the-numbers yarn .
4281	neutral	Self-congratulatory , misguided , and ill-informed , if nonetheless compulsively watchable .
5429	neutral	This will go on so long as there are moviegoers anxious to see strange young guys doing strange guy things .
7203	negative	For the future , one hopes Mr. Plympton will find room for one more member of his little band , a professional screenwriter .
8310	positive	Warm in its loving yet unforgivingly inconsistent depiction of everyday people , relaxed in its perfect quiet pace and proud in its message .
7838	positive	smart , funny and just honest enough to provide the pleasures of a slightly naughty , just-above-average off - Broadway play .
8341	negative	Kurys seems intimidated by both her subject matter and the period trappings of this debut venture into the heritage business .
1022	neutral	As a hybrid teen thriller and murder mystery , Murder by Numbers fits the profile too closely .
1374	positive	The filmmakers try to balance pointed , often incisive satire and unabashed sweetness , with results that are sometimes bracing , sometimes baffling and quite often , and in unexpected ways , touching .
7511	negative	A slow-moving police-procedural thriller that takes its title all too literally .
3958	positive	In a summer of clones , Harvard Man is something rare and riveting : a wild ride that relies on more than special effects .
6991	negative	The results are far more alienating than involving .
551	neutral	Somewhere in the middle , the film compels , as Demme experiments he harvests a few movie moment gems , but the field of roughage dominates .
8150	positive	A thoughtful movie , a movie that is concerned with souls and risk and schemes and the consequences of one 's actions .
2199	positive	A perfectly pleasant if slightly pokey comedy .
1967	neutral	Though it never rises to its full potential as a film , still offers a great deal of insight into the female condition and the timeless danger of emotions repressed .
3971	negative	The problem with all of this : It 's not really funny .
3377	neutral	Brainy , artistic and muted , almost to the point of suffocation .
4032	negative	So we got Ten Little Indians meets Friday the 13th by way of Clean and Sober , filmed on the set of Carpenter 's The Thing and loaded with actors you 're most likely to find on the next inevitable incarnation of The Love Boat .
2577	positive	It 's a quirky , off-beat project .
3632	positive	Because the genre is well established , what makes the movie fresh is smart writing , skewed characters , and the title performance by Kieran Culkin .
6705	positive	Both Garcia and Jagger turn in perfectly executed and wonderfully sympathetic characters , who are alternately touching and funny .
95	negative	Scarcely worth a mention apart from reporting on the number of tumbleweeds blowing through the empty theatres graced with its company .
7629	positive	Yakusho , as always , is wonderful as the long-faced sad sack ... and his chemistry with Shimizu is very believable .
2299	negative	When a movie asks you to feel sorry for Mick Jagger 's sex life , it already has one strike against it .
5501	positive	Good fun , good action , good acting , good dialogue , good pace , good cinematography .

7360	positive	It turns out to be smarter and more diabolical than you could have guessed at the beginning .
838	negative	A film without surprise geared toward maximum comfort and familiarity .
6607	positive	UB equally spoofs and celebrates the more outre aspects of ` black culture ' and the dorkier aspects of ` white culture , ' even as it points out how inseparable the two are .
2100	neutral	The tone errs on the shrill side , tempered by a soft southern gentility that speaks of beauty , grace and a closet full of skeletons .
6810	positive	... wise and elegiac ...
1205	negative	If you 're looking for a story , do n't bother .
857	negative	A cleverly crafted but ultimately hollow mockumentary .
4473	positive	While Broomfield 's film does n't capture the effect of these tragic deaths on hip-hop culture , it succeeds as a powerful look at a failure of our justice system .
8475	neutral	There 's no getting around the fact that this is Revenge Of The Nerds Revisited -- again .
2037	neutral	The date movie that Franz Kafka would have made .
8513	positive	A gracious , eloquent film that by its end offers a ray of hope to the refugees able to look ahead and resist living in a past forever lost .

3700	negative	Can I admit XXX is as deep as a Petri dish and as well-characterized as a telephone book but still say it was a guilty pleasure ?
3165	positive	In Auteil 's less dramatic but equally incisive performance , he 's a charismatic charmer likely to seduce and conquer .
762	positive	A stylish cast and some clever scripting solutions help Chicago make the transition from stage to screen with considerable appeal intact .
6832	negative	A tired , unimaginative and derivative variation of that already-shallow genre .
5744	negative	A devastating indictment of unbridled greed and materalism .
6585	negative	Helmer Hudlin tries to make a hip comedy , but his dependence on slapstick defeats the possibility of creating a more darkly edged tome .
998	negative	I admire it and yet can not recommend it , because it overstays its natural running time .
81	positive	All in all , it 's a pretty good execution of a story that 's a lot richer than the ones Hollywood action screenwriters usually come up with on their own .
6873	positive	and your reward will be a thoughtful , emotional movie experience .
7564	negative	A complete waste of time .

1100	negative	TV skit-com material fervently deposited on the big screen .
4305	negative	Ice Cube is n't quite out of ripe screwball ideas , but Friday After Next spreads them pretty thin .
4235	positive	`` Nicholas Nickleby '' is a perfect family film to take everyone to since there 's no new `` A Christmas Carol '' out in the theaters this year .
2985	neutral	I prefer Soderbergh 's concentration on his two lovers over Tarkovsky 's mostly male , mostly patriarchal debating societies .
5623	negative	Its and pieces of The Hot Chick are so hilarious , and Schneider 's performance is so fine , it 's a real shame that so much of the movie -- again , as in The Animal -- is a slapdash mess .
7750	positive	The obnoxious title character provides the drama that gives added clout to this doc .
3139	neutral	... is there a deeper , more direct connection between these women , one that spans time and reveals meaning ?
2441	positive	If `` Lilo & Stitch '' is n't the most edgy piece of Disney animation to hit the silver screen , then this first film to use a watercolor background since `` Dumbo '' certainly ranks as the most original in years .
6373	positive	A good film with a solid pedigree both in front of and , more specifically , behind the camera .
4551	positive	There is a welcome lack of pretension about the film , which very simply sets out to entertain and ends up delivering in good measure .
4599	positive	A lovely film ... elegant , witty and beneath a prim exterior unabashedly romantic ... hugely enjoyable in its own right though not really faithful to its source 's complexity .
3431	negative	There is n't one moment in the film that surprises or delights .
4055	negative	An inept , tedious spoof of '70s kung fu pictures , it contains almost enough chuckles for a three-minute sketch , and no more .
2537	negative	The Quiet American is n't a bad film , it 's just one that could easily wait for your pay per view dollar .
2706	positive	Short and sweet , but also more than anything else slight ... Tadpole pulls back from the consequences of its own actions and revelations .
8128	positive	Best enjoyed as a work of fiction inspired by real-life events .
683	positive	The year 's greatest adventure , and Jackson 's limited but enthusiastic adaptation has made literature literal without killing its soul -- a feat any thinking person is bound to appreciate .
901	neutral	A disturbing examination of what appears to be the definition of a ` bad ' police shooting .
2932	positive	Combines sharp comedy , old-fashioned monster movie atmospherics , and genuine heart to create a film that 's not merely about kicking undead \*\*\* , but also about dealing with regret and , ultimately , finding redemption .
5493	negative	... a rather bland affair .
8408	positive	An interesting look behind the scenes of Chicago-based rock group Wilco ...
3786	positive	A fine effort , an interesting topic , some intriguing characters and a sad ending .
7682	positive	A sloppy , amusing comedy that proceeds from a stunningly unoriginal premise .
2178	positive	In its understanding , often funny way , it tells a story whose restatement is validated by the changing composition of the nation .
881	negative	... pitiful , slapdash disaster .
2889	positive	Paid in Full is remarkably engaging despite being noticeably derivative of Goodfellas and at least a half dozen other trouble-in-the-ghetto flicks .
1216	negative	A crass and insulting homage to great films like Some Like It Hot and the John Wayne classics .
5829	positive	Each of these stories has the potential for Touched by an Angel simplicity and sappiness , but Thirteen Conversations About One Thing , for all its generosity and optimism , never resorts to easy feel-good sentiments .
7462	positive	This film is an act of spiritual faith -- an eloquent , deeply felt meditation on the nature of compassion .
7144	positive	The stunt work is top-notch ; the dialogue and drama often food-spittingly funny .
6712	negative	Reign of Fire has the disadvantage of also looking cheap .
1059	positive	The new Insomnia is a surprisingly faithful remake of its chilly predecessor , and when it does elect to head off in its own direction , it employs changes that fit it well rather than ones that were imposed for the sake of commercial sensibilities .
2259	negative	Godard 's ode to tackling life 's wonderment is a rambling and incoherent manifesto about the vagueness of topical excess ... In Praise of Love remains a ponderous and pretentious endeavor that 's unfocused and tediously exasperating .
2727	positive	Many insightful moments .
1032	positive	The fascination comes in the power of the Huston performance , which seems so larger than life and yet so fragile , and in the way the Ivan character accepts the news of his illness so quickly but still finds himself unable to react .
5279	neutral	An unflinching look at the world 's dispossessed .
6596	negative	I am more offended by his lack of faith in his audience than by anything on display here .
3931	positive	It 's definitely a step in the right direction .
1422	neutral	With lesser talents , High Crimes would be entertaining , but forgettable .
7127	positive	For once , a movie does not proclaim the truth about two love-struck somebodies , but permits them time and space to convince us of that all on their own .
3303	negative	They kept much of the plot but jettisoned the stuff that would make this a moving experience for people who have n't read the book .
273	negative	It has become apparent that the franchise 's best years are long past .
8200	positive	About as big a crowdpleaser as they possibly come .
6285	positive	The Trials of Henry Kissinger is a remarkable piece of filmmaking ... because you get it .
5671	negative	The problem with `` XXX '' is that its own action is n't very effective .
5573	neutral	Depending upon your reaction to this movie , you may never again be able to look at a red felt Sharpie pen without disgust , a thrill , or the giggles .
6400	neutral	How about starting with a more original story instead of just slapping extreme humor and gross-out gags on top of the same old crap ?
4304	positive	A well-rounded tribute to a man whose achievements -- and complexities -- reached far beyond the end zone .
3044	neutral	Soderbergh seems capable only of delivering artfully lighted , earnest inquiries that lack the kind of genuine depth that would make them redeemable .

6948	negative	A dull , simple-minded and stereotypical tale of drugs , death and mind-numbing indifference on the inner-city streets .

5276	neutral	The film may not hit as hard as some of the better drug-related pictures , but it still manages to get a few punches in .
4676	neutral	Recoing 's fantastic performance does n't exactly reveal what makes Vincent tick , but perhaps any definitive explanation for it would have felt like a cheat .
2871	positive	A wild comedy that could only spring from the demented mind of the writer of Being John Malkovich .
3782	positive	It has its faults , but it is a kind , unapologetic , sweetheart of a movie , and Mandy Moore leaves a positive impression .

3890	positive	Hawn and Sarandon form an acting bond that makes The Banger Sisters a fascinating character study with laughs to spare .

5432	neutral	It briefly flirts with player masochism , but the point of real interest - -- audience sadism -- is evaded completely .
1261	negative	The problem is that it is one that allows him to churn out one mediocre movie after another .
5504	positive	Michael Moore has perfected the art of highly entertaining , self-aggrandizing , politically motivated documentary-making , and he 's got as potent a topic as ever here .
3357	negative	Resident Evil is n't a product of its cinematic predecessors so much as an MTV , sugar hysteria , and PlayStation cocktail .
3291	positive	This rush to profits has created a predictably efficient piece of business notable largely for its overwhelming creepiness , for an eagerness to create images you wish you had n't seen , which , in this day and age , is of course the point .
7149	positive	Wilco is a phenomenal band with such an engrossing story that will capture the minds and hearts of many .
2757	negative	I did n't laugh .
2349	negative	Shafer 's feature does n't offer much in terms of plot or acting .

1634	positive	The universal theme of becoming a better person through love has never been filmed more irresistibly than in ` Baran . '
6092	positive	Despite the predictable parent vs. child coming-of-age theme , first-class , natural acting and a look at `` the real Americans '' make this a charmer .
1800	positive	The overall result is an intelligent , realistic portrayal of testing boundaries .
3540	negative	The film is weighed down by supporting characters who are either too goodly , wise and knowing or downright comically evil .
5057	positive	You 'll probably love it .

818	neutral	At the end of the movie , my 6-year-old nephew said , `` I guess I come from a broken family , and my uncles are all aliens , too . ''

270	positive	Superbly photographed and staged by Mendes with a series of riveting set pieces the likes of which mainstream audiences have rarely seen .
979	negative	... if it had been only half-an-hour long or a TV special , the humor would have been fast and furious -- at ninety minutes , it drags .
7319	neutral	Super Troopers is an odd amalgam of comedy genres , existing somewhere between the often literal riffs of early Zucker Brothers\/Abrahams films , and the decidedly foul stylings of their post-modern contemporaries , The Farrelly Brothers .
2412	negative	Has lost some of the dramatic conviction that underlies the best of comedies ...
5854	neutral	But Death to Smoochy keeps firing until the bitter end .
880	negative	Whole stretches of the film may be incomprehensible to moviegoers not already clad in basic black .
5169	negative	It all unfolds predictably , and the adventures that happen along the way seem repetitive and designed to fill time , providing no real sense of suspense .
6238	negative	Attal 's hang-ups surrounding infidelity are so old-fashioned and , dare I say , outdated , it 's a wonder that he could n't have brought something fresher to the proceedings simply by accident .
3426	negative	The only entertainment you 'll derive from this choppy and sloppy affair will be from unintentional giggles -- several of them .
306	neutral	A late-night cable sexploitation romp masquerading as a thriller about the ruthless social order that governs college cliques .
6865	positive	Even if you do n't understand what on earth is going on , this is a movie that will stimulate hours of post viewing discussion , if only to be reminded of who did what to whom and why .
6499	positive	Nettelbeck ... has a pleasing way with a metaphor .
497	positive	Perfectly pitched between comedy and tragedy , hope and despair , About Schmidt instead comes far closer than many movies to expressing the way many of us live -- someplace between consuming self-absorption and insistently demanding otherness .
2426	positive	One of the best silly horror movies of recent memory , with some real shocks in store for unwary viewers .
2876	negative	Godard uses his characters -- if that 's not too glorified a term -- as art things , mouthpieces , visual motifs , blanks .

5594	positive	Passion , melodrama , sorrow , laugther , and tears cascade over the screen effortlessly ...
7653	positive	This enthralling documentary ... is at once playful and haunting , an in-depth portrait of an iconoclastic artist who was fundamentally unknowable even to his closest friends .

605	negative	Chalk it up as the worst kind of hubristic folly .
7379	negative	The only thing to fear about `` Fear Dot Com '' is hitting your head on the theater seat in front of you when you doze off thirty minutes into the film .
4321	neutral	Chances are you wo n't , either .
3038	positive	Not many movies have that kind of impact on me these days .
6156	negative	Charly comes off as emotionally manipulative and sadly imitative of innumerable past Love Story derisions .
1267	positive	The unexplored story opportunities of `` Punch-Drunk Love '' may have worked against the maker 's minimalist intent but it is an interesting exercise by talented writer\/director Anderson .
6262	neutral	That 's not vintage Spielberg and that , finally , is minimally satisfying .
7188	positive	The movie is ... very funny as you peek at it through the fingers in front of your eyes .
3689	neutral	displays the potential for a better movie than what Bailly manages to deliver
6947	negative	As original and insightful as last week 's episode of Behind the Music .
6984	neutral	Schnitzler 's film has a great hook , some clever bits and well-drawn , if standard issue , characters , but is still only partly satisfying .
4444	negative	Here , common sense flies out the window , along with the hail of bullets , none of which ever seem to hit Sascha .
3993	positive	All leather pants & augmented boobs , Hawn is hilarious as she tries to resuscitate the fun-loving libertine lost somewhere inside the conservative , handbag-clutching Sarandon .
327	neutral	A guilty pleasure at best , and not worth seeing unless you want to laugh at it .
2240	positive	If The Man from Elysian Fields is doomed by its smallness , it is also elevated by it -- the kind of movie that you enjoy more because you 're one of the lucky few who sought it out .
2591	negative	Due to stodgy , soap opera-ish dialogue , the rest of the cast comes across as stick figures reading lines from a TelePrompTer .
377	positive	Twenty years after its first release , E.T. remains the most wondrous of all Hollywood fantasies -- and the apex of Steven Spielberg 's misunderstood career .
7124	neutral	The plan to make Enough into ` an inspiring tale of survival wrapped in the heart-pounding suspense of a stylish psychological thriller '
8539	negative	The French director has turned out nearly 21\/2 hours of unfocused , excruciatingly tedious cinema that , half an hour in , starts making water torture seem appealing .
4173	negative	Everything 's serious , poetic , earnest and -- sadly -- dull .
5944	negative	A pathetic exploitation film that tries to seem sincere , and just seems worse for the effort .
5322	neutral	It 's not exactly worth the bucks to expend the full price for a date , but when it comes out on video , it 's well worth a rental .
4507	negative	It 's a shame the marvelous first 101 minutes have to be combined with the misconceived final 5 .
6791	negative	The dialogue is very choppy and monosyllabic despite the fact that it is being dubbed .
3140	positive	The most ingenious film comedy since Being John Malkovich .
917	negative	Sorvino makes the princess seem smug and cartoonish , and the film only really comes alive when poor Hermocrates and Leontine pathetically compare notes about their budding amours .
1319	negative	The star who helped give a spark to `` Chasing Amy '' and `` Changing Lanes '' falls flat as thinking man CIA agent Jack Ryan in this summer 's new action film , `` The Sum of All Fears . ''
2702	neutral	A relatively effective little potboiler until its absurd , contrived , overblown , and entirely implausible finale .
8193	positive	Assayas ' ambitious , sometimes beautiful adaptation of Jacques Chardonne 's novel .
5468	positive	Ultimately , `` MIB II '' succeeds due to its rapid-fire delivery and enough inspired levity that it ca n't be dismissed as mindless .
6099	negative	A gratingly unfunny groaner littered with zero-dimensional , unlikable characters and hackneyed , threadbare comic setups .
5168	positive	Quietly engaging .
7818	negative	The Sum of All Fears is remarkably fuddled about motives and context , which drains it of the dramatic substance that would shake us in our boots -LRB- or cinema seats -RRB- .
5024	negative	A great script brought down by lousy direction .
5217	negative	Although ... visually striking and slickly staged , it 's also cold , grey , antiseptic and emotionally desiccated .
4576	negative	The feature-length stretch ... strains the show 's concept .
7928	positive	Prepare to marvel again .
6093	negative	Another wholly unnecessary addition to the growing , moldering pile of , well , extreme stunt pictures .
1198	positive	Me no lika da accents so good , but I thoroughly enjoyed the love story .
6940	positive	Oddly , the film is n't nearly as downbeat as it sounds , but strikes a tone that 's alternately melancholic , hopeful and strangely funny .
4358	positive	Colorful , energetic and sweetly whimsical ... the rare sequel that 's better than its predecessor .
5708	negative	Its screenplay serves as auto-critique , and its clumsiness as its own most damning censure .
4221	negative	Halfway through , however , having sucked dry the undead action flick formula , Blade II mutates into a gross-out monster movie with effects that are more silly than scary .
7495	negative	Just dreadful .
1394	positive	... the story , like Ravel 's Bolero , builds to a crescendo that encompasses many more paths than we started with .
7901	positive	-LRB- Clooney 's -RRB- debut can be accused of being a bit undisciplined , but it has a tremendous , offbeat sense of style and humor that suggests he was influenced by some of the filmmakers who have directed him , especially the Coen brothers and Steven Soderbergh .
6222	neutral	Just watch Bettany strut his stuff .
354	negative	Purports to be a Hollywood satire but winds up as the kind of film that should be the target of something deeper and more engaging .
3136	neutral	The path Ice Age follows most closely , though , is the one established by Warner Bros. giant Chuck Jones , who died a matter of weeks before the movie 's release .
5178	positive	Slow and ponderous , but Rohmer 's drama builds to an intense indoor drama about compassion , sacrifice , and Christian love in the face of political corruption .
6053	neutral	If you do n't flee , you might be seduced .
5359	negative	The adventure does n't contain half the excitement of Balto , or quarter the fun of Toy Story 2 .
6352	positive	The pain , loneliness and insecurity of the screenwriting process are vividly and painfully brought to slovenly life in this self-deprecating , biting and witty feature written by Charlie Kaufman and his twin brother , Donald , and directed by Spike Jonze .
1306	positive	If you answered yes , by all means enjoy The New Guy .
6698	negative	A jumbled fantasy comedy that did not figure out a coherent game plan at scripting , shooting or post-production stages .
337	neutral	The filmmaker 's heart is in the right place ...
1408	positive	A wild ride with eight boarders from Venice Beach that was a deserved co-winner of the Audience Award for documentaries at the Sundance Film Festival .
6972	negative	This is the kind of movie where the big scene is a man shot out of a cannon into a vat of ice cream .
394	positive	As averse as I usually am to feel-good , follow-your-dream Hollywood fantasies , this one got to me .
3344	negative	It 's an odd show , pregnant with moods , stillborn except as a harsh conceptual exercise .
6279	negative	It has no affect on the Kurds , but it wore me down .
5235	positive	Tends to pile too many `` serious issues '' on its plate at times , yet remains fairly light , always entertaining , and smartly written .
2333	positive	Even at its worst , it 's not half-bad .
6748	positive	K-19 : The Widowmaker is a great yarn .
6571	negative	Replacing John Carpenter 's stylish tracking shots is degraded , handheld Blair Witch video-cam footage .
1650	positive	Returning director Rob Minkoff ... and screenwriter Bruce Joel Rubin ... have done a fine job of updating White 's dry wit to a new age .
42	positive	Vincent Gallo is right at home in this French shocker playing his usual bad boy weirdo role .
4039	negative	The film is all over the place , really .
7504	negative	Two big things are missing -- anything approaching a visceral kick , and anything approaching even a vague reason to sit through it all .
4203	positive	As a science fiction movie , `` Minority Report '' astounds .
3622	positive	Her performance moves between heartbreak and rebellion as she continually tries to accommodate to fit in and gain the unconditional love she seeks .
4317	negative	A depraved , incoherent , instantly disposable piece of hackery .
5516	negative	Though Impostor deviously adopts the guise of a modern motion picture , it too is a bomb .
2615	positive	Blessed with two fine , nuanced lead performances .
7616	neutral	The tonal shifts are jolting , and though Wen 's messages are profound and thoughtfully delivered , more thorough transitions would have made the film more cohesive .
869	neutral	Kaufman and Jonze take huge risks to ponder the whole notion of passion -- our desire as human beings for passion in our lives and the emptiness one feels when it is missing .
2564	negative	Our culture is headed down the toilet with the ferocity of a frozen burrito after an all-night tequila bender -- and I know this because I 've seen ` jackass : the movie . '
1708	neutral	A rather average action film that benefits from several funny moments supplied by Epps .
2763	negative	This is a truly , truly bad movie .
4478	neutral	The movie just has too much on its plate to really stay afloat for its just under ninety minute running time .
2070	positive	I 've never bought from telemarketers , but I bought this movie .

3428	neutral	... a story , an old and scary one , about the monsters we make , and the vengeance they take .
2026	positive	An odd drama set in the world of lingerie models and bar dancers in the Midwest that held my interest precisely because it did n't try to .
3539	positive	This is an elegantly balanced movie -- every member of the ensemble has something fascinating to do -- that does n't reveal even a hint of artifice .
266	neutral	... a preachy parable stylized with a touch of John Woo bullet ballet .
6383	negative	And for all the wrong reasons besides .
2389	neutral	foreshadowing
5371	neutral	Whether our action-and-popcorn obsessed culture will embrace this engaging and literate psychodrama is n't much of a mystery , unfortunately .

6254	positive	Serious and thoughtful .
7002	positive	A sweet , tender sermon about a 12-year-old Welsh boy more curious about God than girls , who learns that believing in something does matter .
104	positive	Changing Lanes tries for more .
861	negative	This is as lax and limp a comedy as I 've seen in a while , a meander through worn-out material .
3029	positive	It is about irrational , unexplainable life and it seems so real because it does not attempt to filter out the complexity .
4549	neutral	A plodding look at the French Revolution through the eyes of aristocrats .
7472	negative	Every visual joke is milked , every set-up obvious and lengthy , every punchline predictable .
7972	neutral	If Reno is to the left of liberal on the political spectrum , her tough , funny , rather chaotic show is n't subversive so much as it is nit-picky about the hypocrisies of our time .
1669	negative	... another example of how Sandler is losing his touch .
193	positive	Manages to please its intended audience -- children -- without placing their parents in a coma-like state .
569	negative	The first question to ask about Bad Company is why Anthony Hopkins is in it .
5628	positive	Like Kubrick , Soderbergh is n't afraid to try any genre and to do it his own way .
7690	neutral	Tsai has managed to create an underplayed melodrama about family dynamics and dysfunction that harks back to the spare , unchecked heartache of Yasujiro Ozu .
8005	neutral	Tom Green and an Ivy League college should never appear together on a marquee , especially when the payoff is an unschooled comedy like Stealing Harvard , which fails to keep 80 minutes from seeming like 800 .
5876	positive	Nicholas Nickleby celebrates the human spirit with such unrelenting Dickensian decency that it turned me -LRB- horrors ! -RRB-
4814	neutral	Sa da TAY !
7527	negative	The movie is the equivalent of French hip-hop , which also seems to play on a 10-year delay .
246	positive	This movie may not have the highest production values you 've ever seen , but it 's the work of an artist , one whose view of America , history and the awkwardness of human life is generous and deep .
1199	negative	The movie 's biggest shocks come from seeing former nymphette Juliette Lewis playing a salt-of-the-earth mommy named Minnie and watching Slim travel incognito in a ridiculous wig no respectable Halloween costume shop would ever try to sell .
6474	negative	No , I hate it .
5691	negative	Somewhere inside the mess that is World Traveler , there is a mediocre movie trying to get out .
1711	negative	I 'm convinced I could keep a family of five blind , crippled , Amish people alive in this situation better than these British soldiers do at keeping themselves kicking .
5001	negative	While this film has an ` A ' list cast and some strong supporting players , the tale -- like its central figure , Vivi -- is just a little bit hard to love .
3018	positive	Lovingly photographed in the manner of a Golden Book sprung to life , Stuart Little 2 manages sweetness largely without stickiness .
2911	positive	Some people march to the beat of a different drum , and if you ever wondered what kind of houses those people live in , this documentary takes a look at 5 alternative housing options .
7086	positive	Niccol the filmmaker merges his collaborators ' symbolic images with his words , insinuating , for example , that in Hollywood , only God speaks to the press
8045	neutral	The dark and bittersweet twist feels strange as things turn nasty and tragic during the final third of the film .
4859	negative	But there 's plenty to offend everyone ...
1896	negative	Mindless and boring martial arts and gunplay with too little excitement and zero compelling storyline .
6695	neutral	Wow , a jump cut !
2065	positive	Beautiful , cold , oddly colorful and just plain otherworldly , a freaky bit of art that 's there to scare while we delight in the images .

4475	positive	The sentimental cliches mar an otherwise excellent film .
6633	neutral	Reeboir varies between a sweet smile and an angry bark , while Said attempts to wear down possible pupils through repetition .
7190	negative	We get the comedy we settle for .
2	positive	This quiet , introspective and entertaining independent is worth seeking .
7493	negative	The Sweetest Thing leaves an awful sour taste .
2164	positive	Writer\/director Walter Hill is in his hypermasculine element here , once again able to inject some real vitality and even art into a pulpy concept that , in many other hands would be completely forgettable .
3360	negative	No thanks .
140	positive	Sleek and arty .
5641	positive	borrows a bit from the classics `` Wait Until Dark '' and `` Extremities '' ... But in terms of its style , the movie is in a class by itself .
4121	positive	Rarely has skin looked as beautiful , desirable , even delectable , as it does in Trouble Every Day .
5617	negative	An almost unbearably morbid love story .

685	positive	When all is said and done , she loves them to pieces -- and so , I trust , will you .
6556	neutral	Despite the pyrotechnics , Narc is strictly by the book .
3728	negative	It 's a pedestrian , flat drama that screams out ` amateur ' in almost every frame .
3621	negative	It 's not an easy one to review .
3004	negative	What soured me on The Santa Clause 2 was that Santa bumps up against 21st century reality so hard , it 's icky .

7099	neutral	Spy-vs .
984	positive	`` Red Dragon '' never cuts corners .
7850	positive	Even if you do n't know the band or the album 's songs by heart , you will enjoy seeing how both evolve , and you will also learn a good deal about the state of the music business in the 21st Century .
3216	positive	There is no denying the power of Polanski 's film ...
1518	negative	A really good premise is frittered away in middle-of-the-road blandness .
4894	negative	As plain and pedestrian as catsup --
896	negative	Feels more like a rejected X-Files episode than a credible account of a puzzling real-life happening .
4369	negative	An amateurish , quasi-improvised acting exercise shot on ugly digital video .
3049	negative	Viewers will need all the luck they can muster just figuring out who 's who in this pretentious mess .
1095	positive	Reassuring , retro uplifter .
6693	negative	The exclamation point seems to be the only bit of glee you 'll find in this dreary mess .
4516	negative	Wishy-washy .
6672	negative	When the casting call for this movie went out , it must have read ` seeking anyone with acting ambition but no sense of pride or shame . '
2833	negative	Whether this is art imitating life or life imitating art , it 's an unhappy situation all around .
6691	negative	Will undoubtedly play well in European markets , where Mr. Besson is a brand name , and in Asia , where Ms. Shu is an institution , but American audiences will probably find it familiar and insufficiently cathartic .
7607	negative	-LRB- Seems -RRB- even more uselessly redundant and shamelessly money-grubbing than most third-rate horror sequels .
5989	negative	It is that rare combination of bad writing , bad direction and bad acting -- the trifecta of badness .
8270	positive	The film is hard to dismiss -- moody , thoughtful , and lit by flashes of mordant humor .
8169	negative	The screenplay flounders under the weight of too many story lines .
859	negative	An unintentionally surreal kid 's picture ... in which actors in bad bear suits enact a sort of inter-species parody of a VH1 Behind the Music episode .
3517	positive	As giddy and whimsical and relevant today as it was 270 years ago .
3102	negative	It 's also curious to note that this film , like the similarly ill-timed Antitrust , is easily as bad at a fraction the budget .
7699	negative	Too smart to ignore but a little too smugly superior to like , this could be a movie that ends up slapping its target audience in the face by shooting itself in the foot .
2568	negative	One of the worst movies of the year .
7480	negative	Possibly the most irresponsible picture ever released by a major film studio .
4093	negative	-LRB- Lin Chung 's -RRB- voice is rather unexceptional , even irritating -LRB- at least to this Western ear -RRB- , making it awfully hard to buy the impetus for the complicated love triangle that develops between the three central characters .
2579	negative	Stuffy , full of itself , morally ambiguous and nothing to shout about .
1008	neutral	I found myself more appreciative of what the director was trying to do than of what he had actually done .
4541	negative	Thoroughly awful .
7526	negative	Generic thriller junk .
7773	positive	A bittersweet film , simple in form but rich with human events .
84	positive	Inventive , fun , intoxicatingly sexy , violent , self-indulgent and maddening .
6333	positive	In a summer overrun with movies dominated by CGI aliens and super heroes , it revigorates the mind to see a feature that concentrates on people , a project in which the script and characters hold sway .
4501	positive	This is an interesting movie ! ''
4371	positive	A meditation on faith and madness , Frailty is blood-curdling stuff .
6302	negative	The script falls back on too many tried-and-true shenanigans that hardly distinguish it from the next teen comedy .
6857	positive	Cantet beautifully illuminates what it means sometimes to be inside looking out , and at other times outside looking in .
8336	negative	When it comes out on video , then it 's the perfect cure for insomnia .
6257	positive	Shiri is an action film that delivers on the promise of excitement , but it also has a strong dramatic and emotional pull that gradually sneaks up on the audience .
54	negative	Comes across as a relic from a bygone era , and its convolutions ... feel silly rather than plausible .
4027	positive	The performances of the children , untrained in acting , have an honesty and dignity that breaks your heart .
1869	negative	About half of them are funny , a few are sexy and none are useful in telling the story , which is paper-thin and decidedly unoriginal .
7304	negative	The author 's devotees will probably find it fascinating ; others may find it baffling .
3191	negative	Carrying this wafer-thin movie on his nimble shoulders , Chan wades through putrid writing , direction and timing with a smile that says , ` If I stay positive , maybe I can channel one of my greatest pictures , Drunken Master . '
1194	negative	Bigelow handles the nuclear crisis sequences evenly but milks drama when she should be building suspense , and drags out too many scenes toward the end that should move quickly .
723	positive	Successfully blended satire , high camp and yet another sexual taboo into a really funny movie .
6690	positive	He allows his cast members to make creative contributions to the story and dialogue .

5555	positive	... spiced with humor -LRB- ' I speak fluent flatula , ' advises Denlopp after a rather , er , bubbly exchange with an alien deckhand -RRB- and witty updatings -LRB- Silver 's parrot has been replaced with Morph , a cute alien creature who mimics everyone and everything around -RRB-
1341	neutral	But it is set in a world that is very , very far from the one most of us inhabit .
5734	positive	By turns very dark and very funny .
7370	neutral	A respectable venture on its own terms , lacking the broader vision that has seen certain Trek films ... cross over to a more mainstream audience .
7235	negative	The film never gets over its own investment in conventional arrangements , in terms of love , age , gender , race , and class .
5202	positive	One of the smarter offerings the horror genre has produced in recent memory , even if it 's far tamer than advertised .
6966	positive	Huppert and Girardot give performances of exceptional honesty .
3110	positive	The 3-D vistas from orbit , with the space station suspended like a huge set of wind chimes over the great blue globe , are stanzas of breathtaking , awe-inspiring visual poetry .
2248	neutral	It remains to be seen whether Statham can move beyond the crime-land action genre , but then again , who says he has to ?
4974	negative	It 's too interested in jerking off in all its Byzantine incarnations to bother pleasuring its audience .
490	positive	Romantic , riveting and handsomely animated .
2313	positive	The film is impressive for the sights and sounds of the wondrous beats the world has to offer .
3460	negative	Just because A Walk to Remember is shrewd enough to activate girlish tear ducts does n't mean it 's good enough for our girls .
5138	positive	What 's really so appealing about the characters is their resemblance to everyday children .
3922	negative	Sheridan 's take on the author 's schoolboy memoir ... is a rather toothless take on a hard young life .
3031	neutral	Davis the performer is plenty fetching enough , but she needs to shake up the mix , and work in something that does n't feel like a half-baked stand-up routine .
7509	positive	An engrossing portrait of a man whose engaging manner and flamboyant style made him a truly larger-than-life character .
5495	negative	... it was n't the subject matter that ultimately defeated the film ... It was the unfulfilling , incongruous , `` wait a second , did I miss something ? ''
2843	positive	Originality ai n't on the menu , but there 's never a dull moment in the giant spider invasion comic chiller .
721	neutral	It 's like a `` Big Chill '' reunion of the Baader-Meinhof Gang , only these guys are more harmless pranksters than political activists .
7391	neutral	It 's not a film to be taken literally on any level , but its focus always appears questionable .
3041	positive	It 's not just a feel-good movie , it 's a feel movie .
894	negative	Before long , you 're desperate for the evening to end .
5701	positive	Confessions is without a doubt a memorable directorial debut from King Hunk .
3886	negative	A selection of scenes in search of a movie .

5094	negative	Several uninteresting , unlikeable people do bad things to and with each other in `` Unfaithful . ''

6999	positive	A tasty masala .
7888	negative	The comedy is nonexistent .
4051	negative	Bad and baffling from the get-go .
7295	neutral	It is n't that the picture is unfamiliar , but that it manages to find new avenues of discourse on old problems .

5085	positive	... an enjoyably frothy ` date movie ' ...
414	positive	Cremaster 3 is at once a tough pill to swallow and a minor miracle of self-expression .
4689	positive	This is a finely written , superbly acted offbeat thriller .
8457	negative	Ill-considered , unholy hokum .
5398	negative	There may have been a good film in `` Trouble Every Day , '' but it is not what is on the screen .

7706	negative	Just a Kiss is a just a waste .
3083	positive	On that score , the film certainly does n't disappoint .
516	positive	So purely enjoyable that you might not even notice it 's a fairly straightforward remake of Hollywood comedies such as Father of the Bride .

19	negative	As inept as big-screen remakes of The Avengers and The Wild Wild West .

2356	negative	This is a poster movie , a mediocre tribute to films like Them !
5046	positive	Director Paul Cox 's unorthodox , abstract approach to visualizing Nijinsky 's diaries is both stimulating and demanding .
179	positive	Beautifully crafted , engaging filmmaking that should attract upscale audiences hungry for quality and a nostalgic , twisty yarn that will keep them guessing .

5407	neutral	If Signs is a good film , and it is , the essence of a great one is in there somewhere .
7106	negative	Whether it 's the worst movie of 2002 , I ca n't say for sure : Memories of Rollerball have faded , and I skipped Country Bears .
4517	negative	Hypnotically dull , relentlessly downbeat , laughably predictable wail pitched to the cadence of a depressed fifteen-year-old 's suicidal poetry .
4707	negative	What little grace -LRB- Rifkin 's -RRB- tale of precarious skid-row dignity achieves is pushed into the margins by predictable plotting and tiresome histrionics .
4442	positive	By the end of the movie , you 're definitely convinced that these women are spectacular .
5179	neutral	`` The turntable is now outselling the electric guitar ... ''
4901	negative	If only Merchant paid more attention the story .
2167	positive	Naomi Watts is terrific as Rachel ; her petite frame and vulnerable persona emphasising her plight and isolation .
2991	neutral	The setting is so cool that it chills the characters , reducing our emotional stake in the outcome of `` Intacto 's '' dangerous and seductively stylish game .

3366	negative	The thing just never gets off the ground .
7278	positive	Ong 's promising debut is a warm and well-told tale of one recent Chinese immigrant 's experiences in New York City .
2617	neutral	If you 're paying attention , the `` big twists '' are pretty easy to guess - but that does n't make the movie any less entertaining .
7910	neutral	Sex With Strangers will shock many with its unblinking frankness .
535	negative	If the title is a Jeopardy question , then the answer might be `` How does Steven Seagal come across these days ? ''

1691	positive	Offers a clear-eyed chronicle of a female friendship that is more complex and honest than anything represented in a Hollywood film .
2960	positive	Until it goes off the rails in its final 10 or 15 minutes , Wendigo , Larry Fessenden 's spooky new thriller , is a refreshingly smart and newfangled variation on several themes derived from far less sophisticated and knowing horror films .
4187	positive	Moore provides an invaluable service by sparking debate and encouraging thought .
4390	neutral	Jackson tries to keep the plates spinning as best he can , but all the bouncing back and forth ca n't help but become a bit tedious -- even with the breathtaking landscapes and villainous varmints there to distract you from the ricocheting .
4042	negative	The movie does n't think much of its characters , its protagonist , or of us .
2652	positive	Ourside the theatre Roger might be intolerable company , but inside it he 's well worth spending some time with .
3820	positive	Although it includes a fair share of dumb drug jokes and predictable slapstick , `` Orange County '' is far funnier than it would seem to have any right to be .
5297	neutral	... little more than a well-acted television melodrama shot for the big screen .
2563	negative	The film itself is about something very interesting and odd that would probably work better as a real documentary without the insinuation of mediocre acting or a fairly trite narrative .
830	neutral	Or else a doggie winks .

3184	negative	Has all the complexity and realistic human behavior of an episode of General Hospital .
5924	positive	The film has an infectious enthusiasm and we 're touched by the film 's conviction that all life centered on that place , that time and that sport .

2689	negative	I never thought I 'd say this , but I 'd much rather watch teens poking their genitals into fruit pies !
5048	positive	The film is a fierce dance of destruction .
5931	positive	-LRB- Grant -RRB- goes beyond his usual fluttering and stammering and captures the soul of a man in pain who gradually comes to recognize it and deal with it .
2049	positive	Proof once again that if the filmmakers just follow the books , they ca n't go wrong .
755	positive	Though few will argue that it ranks with the best of Herzog 's works , Invincible shows he 's back in form , with an astoundingly rich film .
6434	negative	Not so much farcical as sour .
5262	positive	It is as uncompromising as it is nonjudgmental , and makes clear that a prostitute can be as lonely and needy as any of the clients .
5063	negative	Yes , Spirited Away is a triumph of imagination , but it 's also a failure of storytelling .
629	positive	Although the subject matter may still be too close to recent national events , the film works - mostly due to its superior cast of characters .

5748	positive	But even while his characters are acting horribly , he is always sympathetic .
6933	positive	In the end , the film is less the cheap thriller you 'd expect than it is a fairly revealing study of its two main characters -- damaged-goods people whose orbits will inevitably and dangerously collide .
759	positive	Not a schlocky creature feature but something far more stylish and cerebral -- and , hence , more chillingly effective .
5524	neutral	It comes off as so silly that you would n't be surprised if BA , Murdock and rest of the A-Team were seen giving chase in a black and red van .
6846	positive	-LRB- Has -RRB- an immediacy and an intimacy that sucks you in and dares you not to believe it 's all true .
3947	negative	Unfunny comedy with a lot of static set ups , not much camera movement , and most of the scenes take place indoors in formal settings with motionless characters .

6880	positive	Funny , sexy , devastating and incurably romantic .

4378	neutral	Twist open the Ouzo !
6357	neutral	Blade II has a brilliant director and charismatic star , but it suffers from rampant vampire devaluation .
8138	negative	Mostly , Shafer and co-writer Gregory Hinton lack a strong-minded viewpoint , or a sense of humor .

2973	negative	Just consider what New Best Friend does not have , beginning with the minor omission of a screenplay .
1662	negative	It is supremely unfunny and unentertaining to watch middle-age and older men drink to excess , piss on trees , b.s. one another and put on a show in drag .
2918	neutral	But the execution is a flop with the exception of about six gags that really work .
3021	positive	A delightful entree in the tradition of food movies .
8113	negative	It aimlessly and unsuccessfully attempts to fuse at least three dull plots into one good one .
1803	neutral	` Tadpole ' was one of the films so declared this year , but it 's really more of The Next Pretty Good Thing .
4661	neutral	Admirably ambitious but self-indulgent .
46	positive	Less the sensational true-crime hell-jaunt purists might like and more experimental in its storytelling -LRB- though no less horrifying for it -RRB- .

5984	negative	Almost as offensive as `` Freddy Got Fingered . ''
7703	positive	Fun and nimble .
6201	negative	Like a three-ring circus , there are side stories aplenty -- none of them memorable .

1162	negative	Press the delete key .
6310	positive	Undoubtedly the scariest movie ever made about tattoos .
4342	positive	Lathan and Diggs carry the film with their charisma , and both exhibit sharp comic timing that makes the more hackneyed elements of the film easier to digest .
1987	negative	The whole thing comes off like a particularly amateurish episode of Bewitched that takes place during Spring Break .
4388	neutral	Like an episode of MTV 's Undressed , with 20 times the creativity but without any more substance ... indulgently entertaining but could have and should have been deeper .
7226	negative	The director 's many dodges and turns add up to little more than a screenful of gamesmanship that 's low on both suspense and payoff .

6393	positive	The mood , look and tone of the film fit the incredible storyline to a T.
6912	positive	I admire the closing scenes of the film , which seem to ask whether our civilization offers a cure for Vincent 's complaint .
4715	positive	The movie 's seams may show ... but Pellington gives `` Mothman '' an irresistibly uncanny ambience that goes a long way toward keeping the picture compelling .
5577	neutral	Greengrass -LRB- working from Don Mullan 's script -RRB- forgoes the larger socio-political picture of the situation in Northern Ireland in favour of an approach that throws one in the pulsating thick of a truly frightening situation .
7299	neutral	There are times when you wish that the movie had worked a little harder to conceal its contrivances , but Brown Sugar turns out to be a sweet and enjoyable fantasy .
4856	negative	Over and over again .
2637	positive	It 's a beautiful film , full of elaborate and twisted characters - and it 's also pretty funny .
6678	neutral	Director-chef Gabriele Muccino keeps it fast -- zippy , comin ' at ya -- as if fearing that his film is molto superficiale .
6105	positive	He 's the scariest guy you 'll see all summer .
6116	negative	Not at all clear what it 's trying to say and even if it were -- I doubt it would be all that interesting .

2604	negative	Watching Queen of the Damned is like reading a research paper , with special effects tossed in .
2815	negative	Far too clever by half , Howard 's film is really a series of strung-together moments , with all the spaces in between filled with fantasies , daydreams , memories and one fantastic visual trope after another .
7128	negative	A dull , somnambulant exercise in pretension whose pervasive quiet is broken by frequent outbursts of violence and noise .
3868	neutral	No matter how firmly director John Stainton has his tongue in his cheek , the fact remains that a wacky concept does not a movie make .

1893	positive	If you 're looking for something new and hoping for something entertaining , you 're in luck .
1170	positive	It throws quirky characters , odd situations , and off-kilter dialogue at us , all as if to say , `` Look at this !
3011	positive	Confessions may not be a straightforward bio , nor does it offer much in the way of Barris ' motivations , but the film is an oddly fascinating depiction of an architect of pop culture .
6479	positive	As played by Ryan Gosling , Danny is a frighteningly fascinating contradiction .
5415	negative	The verdict : Two bodies and hardly a laugh between them .
1351	positive	This sensitive , smart , savvy , compelling coming-of-age drama delves into the passive-aggressive psychology of co-dependence and the struggle for self-esteem .

2569	negative	Ignore the reputation , and ignore the film .
344	negative	Remember back when thrillers actually thrilled ?
4752	neutral	` Sophisticated ' viewers who refuse to admit that they do n't like it will likely call it ` challenging ' to their fellow sophisticates .
7810	negative	The movie is like Scorsese 's Mean Streets redone by someone who ignored it in favor of old ` juvenile delinquent ' paperbacks with titles like Leather Warriors and Switchblade Sexpot .
1057	positive	It does n't matter that the film is less than 90 minutes .
1908	negative	... no charm , no laughs , no fun , no reason to watch .
2172	neutral	It is there to give them a good time .
3048	negative	Blue Crush is so prolonged and boring it is n't even close to being the barn-burningly bad movie it promised it would be .

27	neutral	A film that clearly means to preach exclusively to the converted .
1941	negative	A thriller without a lot of thrills .

2828	negative	Mr. Goyer 's loose , unaccountable direction is technically sophisticated in the worst way .
5366	positive	Elaborate special effects take centre screen , so that the human story is pushed to one side .
7780	neutral	Jones helps breathe some life into the insubstantial plot , but even he is overwhelmed by predictability .

4002	positive	Strange occurrences build in the mind of the viewer and take on extreme urgency .
8091	negative	Haneke 's script -LRB- from Elfriede Jelinek 's novel -RRB- is contrived , unmotivated , and psychologically unpersuasive , with an inconclusive ending .
7014	neutral	Ninety minutes of Viva Castro !
3452	positive	Others , more attuned to the anarchist maxim that ` the urge to destroy is also a creative urge ' , or more willing to see with their own eyes , will find Morrison 's iconoclastic uses of technology to be liberating .
1028	negative	-- that the ` true story ' by which All the Queen 's Men is allegedly `` inspired '' was a lot funnier and more deftly enacted than what 's been cobbled together onscreen .

1281	negative	After an hour and a half of wondering -- sometimes amusedly , sometimes impatiently -- just what this strenuously unconventional movie is supposed to be , you discover that the answer is as conventional as can be .
6653	negative	Plays like one long , meandering sketch inspired by the works of John Waters and Todd Solondz , rather than a fully developed story .

1938	positive	-LRB- At least -RRB- Moore is a real charmer .
3197	positive	An incredibly thoughtful , deeply meditative picture that neatly and effectively captures the debilitating grief felt in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks .

3559	neutral	There 's a thin line between likably old-fashioned and fuddy-duddy , and The Count of Monte Cristo ... never quite settles on either side .
2255	positive	As a director , Paxton is surprisingly brilliant , deftly sewing together what could have been a confusing and horrifying vision into an intense and engrossing head-trip .
5740	positive	A coming-of-age tale from New Zealand whose boozy , languid air is balanced by a rich visual clarity and deeply felt performances across the board .
7672	neutral	It 's just a little too self-satisfied .
1876	negative	No matter how much he runs around and acts like a doofus , accepting a 50-year-old in the role is creepy in a Michael Jackson sort of way .
2241	negative	There 's nothing interesting in Unfaithful whatsoever .
6315	neutral	This is n't a retooled genre piece , the tale of a guy and his gun , but an amiably idiosyncratic work .

2775	positive	The entire movie establishes a wonderfully creepy mood .
4289	negative	To the civilized mind , a movie like Ballistic : Ecks Vs. Sever is more of an ordeal than an amusement .

7441	positive	Most consumers of lo mein and General Tso 's chicken barely give a thought to the folks who prepare and deliver it , so , hopefully , this film will attach a human face to all those little steaming cartons .

1537	neutral	Many of Benjamins ' elements feel like they 've been patched in from an episode of Miami Vice .
2755	positive	At once subtle and visceral , the film never succumbs to the trap of the maudlin or tearful , offering instead with its unflinching gaze a measure of faith in the future .
3261	neutral	A perfectly competent and often imaginative film that lacks what little Lilo & Stitch had in spades -- charisma .
1684	positive	A compelling film .
7503	negative	Do we really need the Tiger Beat version ?

7537	negative	A lot of talent is wasted in this crass , low-wattage endeavor .
1932	negative	It 's provocative stuff , but the speculative effort is hampered by Taylor 's cartoonish performance and the film 's ill-considered notion that Hitler 's destiny was shaped by the most random of chances .

6495	positive	A knowing look at female friendship , spiked with raw urban humor .
6964	neutral	The film 's stagecrafts are intimate and therefore bolder than the otherwise calculated artifice that defines and overwhelms the film 's production design .
291	neutral	Got a David Lynch jones ?
7777	positive	More concerned with overall feelings , broader ideas , and open-ended questions than concrete story and definitive answers , Soderbergh 's Solaris is a gorgeous and deceptively minimalist cinematic tone poem .

7371	positive	A movie that both thrills the eye and , in its over-the-top way , touches the heart .

6629	negative	The rest of the film ... is dudsville .

264	negative	One senses in World Traveler and in his earlier film that Freundlich bears a grievous but obscure complaint against fathers , and circles it obsessively , without making contact .
3730	negative	Evelyn may be based on a true and historically significant story , but the filmmakers have made every effort to disguise it as an unimaginative screenwriter 's invention .
5323	positive	Children , Christian or otherwise , deserve to hear the full story of Jonah 's despair -- in all its agonizing , Catch-22 glory -- even if they spend years trying to comprehend it .
2379	negative	The Country Bears wastes an exceptionally good idea .
7158	positive	Do n't wait to see this terrific film with your kids -- if you do n't have kids borrow some .
2593	positive	With a cast of A-list Brit actors , it is worth searching out .
5428	negative	The movie is n't painfully bad , something to be ` fully experienced ' ; it 's just tediously bad , something to be fully forgotten .
2014	negative	The script by Vincent R. Nebrida ... tries to cram too many ingredients into one small pot .
2519	negative	But this time , the old MIB label stands for Milder Is n't Better .

2995	neutral	Slow , silly and unintentionally hilarious .
2212	positive	Rich in shadowy metaphor and as sharp as a samurai sword , Jiang Wen 's Devils on the Doorstep is a wartime farce in the alternately comic and gut-wrenching style of Joseph Heller or Kurt Vonnegut .
3523	negative	Sandra Bullock , despite downplaying her good looks , carries a little too much ai n't - she-cute baggage into her lead role as a troubled and determined homicide cop to quite pull off the heavy stuff .
7481	positive	Steven Spielberg brings us another masterpiece
657	positive	So vivid a portrait of a woman consumed by lust and love and crushed by betrayal that it conjures up the intoxicating fumes and emotional ghosts of a freshly painted Rembrandt .

122	neutral	Absorbing character
7842	negative	But how it washed out despite all of that is the project 's prime mystery .

2784	positive	Better effects , better acting and a hilarious Kenneth Branagh .
2276	positive	Now here 's a sadistic bike flick that would have made Vittorio De Sica proud .

3680	positive	A great companion piece to other Napoleon films .
2664	negative	Although sensitive to a fault , it 's often overwritten , with a surfeit of weighty revelations , flowery dialogue , and nostalgia for the past and roads not taken .

6162	positive	Very well-written and very well-acted .
1882	negative	A 75-minute sample of puerile rubbish that is listless , witless , and devoid of anything resembling humor .

1501	negative	Kirshner and Monroe seem to be in a contest to see who can out-bad-act the other .
5648	positive	As commander-in-chief of this film , Bigelow demonstrates a breadth of vision and an attention to detail that propels her into the upper echelons of the directing world .
2605	negative	Adam Sandler 's Eight Crazy Nights grows on you -- like a rash .
1586	positive	A memorable experience that , like many of his works , presents weighty issues colorfully wrapped up in his own idiosyncratic strain of kitschy goodwill .
4019	neutral	Britney 's performance can not be faulted .
5019	negative	A major waste ... generic .
2848	negative	You 'd be hard put to find a movie character more unattractive or odorous -LRB- than Leon -RRB- .
1529	positive	The Chateau belongs to Rudd , whose portrait of a therapy-dependent flakeball spouting French malapropisms ... is a nonstop hoot .
3302	positive	It 's light on the chills and heavy on the atmospheric weirdness , and there are moments of jaw-droppingly odd behavior -- yet I found it weirdly appealing .

7882	positive	It 's a clear-eyed portrait of an intensely lived time , filled with nervous energy , moral ambiguity and great uncertainties .

4777	positive	The structure is simple , but in its own way , Rabbit-Proof Fence is a quest story as grand as The Lord of the Rings .
5056	negative	The story is lacking any real emotional impact , and the plot is both contrived and cliched .

7729	positive	A moving , if uneven , success .
2134	positive	Criminal conspiracies and true romances move so easily across racial and cultural lines in the film that it makes My Big Fat Greek Wedding look like an apartheid drama .

1596	positive	Noyce has worked wonders with the material .
28	negative	While The Importance of Being Earnest offers opportunities for occasional smiles and chuckles , it does n't give us a reason to be in the theater beyond Wilde 's wit and the actors ' performances .

3581	negative	Dramatically lackluster .
5239	negative	The connected stories of Breitbart and Hanussen are actually fascinating , but the filmmaking in Invincible is such that the movie does not do them justice .

6757	negative	Once Ice-T sticks his mug in the window of the couple 's BMW and begins haranguing the wife in bad stage dialogue , all credibility flies out the window .
810	positive	-LRB- Allen 's -RRB- best works understand why snobbery is a better satiric target than middle-America diversions could ever be .
7290	neutral	Perhaps not since Nelson Eddy crooned his Indian Love Call to Jeanette MacDonald has there been a movie so unabashedly Canadian , not afraid to risk American scorn or disinterest .
8108	negative	None of this sounds promising and , indeed , the first half of Sorority Boys is as appalling as any ` comedy ' to ever spill from a projector 's lens .
4191	positive	captures that perverse element of the Kafkaesque where identity , overnight , is robbed and replaced with a persecuted `` other . ''
4829	neutral	It 's clear that Mehta simply wanted to update her beloved genre for the thousands of Indians who fancy themselves too sophisticated for the cheese-laced spectacles that pack 'em in on the subcontinent .

2997	positive	Thanks to a small star with big heart , this family film sequel is plenty of fun for all .
6897	positive	Offers a guilt-free trip into feel-good territory .
7385	negative	Like Schindler 's List , The Grey Zone attempts to be grandiloquent , but ends up merely pretentious -- in a grisly sort of way .
1077	positive	If the material is slight and admittedly manipulative , Jacquot preserves Tosca 's intoxicating ardor through his use of the camera .
7981	positive	It was only a matter of time before some savvy producer saw the potential success inherent in the mixture of Bullock Bubble and Hugh Goo .
3754	positive	Its metaphors are opaque enough to avoid didacticism , and the film succeeds as an emotionally accessible , almost mystical work .
6070	positive	Paul Bettany is cool .
8298	negative	It does n't really know or care about the characters , and uses them as markers for a series of preordained events .
1182	negative	But here 's a movie about it anyway .
7318	negative	It 's a Frankenstein-monster of a film that does n't know what it wants to be .
5275	negative	Hollywood Ending just is n't very funny .

4258	negative	Suspend your disbelief here and now , or you 'll be shaking your head all the way to the credits .
5095	negative	Plays like the old disease-of-the-week small-screen melodramas .
500	negative	So exaggerated and broad that it comes off as annoying rather than charming .
647	negative	Shankman ... and screenwriter Karen Janszen bungle their way through the narrative as if it were a series of Bible parables and not an actual story .
1129	positive	What a bewilderingly brilliant and entertaining movie this is .
1389	negative	A few pieces of the film buzz and whir ; very little of it actually clicks .
7331	neutral	Not everything in the film works , including its somewhat convenient ending .
6555	positive	The filmmakers wisely decided to let Crocodile Hunter Steve Irwin do what he does best , and fashion a story around him .
8500	negative	Crossroads feels like a teenybopper Ed Wood film , replete with the pubescent scandalous innuendo and the high-strung but flaccid drama .
2318	positive	Initially gripping , eventually cloying POW drama .
2488	positive	Pacino and Williams seem to keep upping the ante on each other , just as their characters do in the film .
2249	positive	Though in some ways similar to Catherine Breillat 's Fat Girl , Rain is the far superior film .
4301	negative	What a great shame that such a talented director as Chen Kaige has chosen to make his English-language debut with a film so poorly plotted and scripted .
2264	negative	The emotional overload of female angst irreparably drags the film down .
7984	positive	The closest thing to the experience of space travel
6614	neutral	None of his actors stand out , but that 's less of a problem here than it would be in another film : Characterization matters less than atmosphere .
6990	neutral	In a 102-minute film , Aaliyah gets at most 20 minutes of screen time .
3331	negative	An average B-movie with no aspirations to be anything more .
24	neutral	That the Chuck Norris `` grenade gag '' occurs about 7 times during Windtalkers is a good indication of how serious-minded the film is .
2160	negative	Naipaul fans may be disappointed .
3869	negative	Seemingly a vehicle to showcase the Canadian 's inane ramblings , Stealing Harvard is a smorgasbord of soliloquies about nothing delivered by the former Mr. Drew Barrymore .
7994	neutral	Quelle surprise !
7718	positive	Impossible as it may sound , this film 's heart is even more embracing than Monty , if only because it accepts nasty behavior and severe flaws as part of the human condition .
4170	negative	Their parents would do well to cram earplugs in their ears and put pillowcases over their heads for 87 minutes .
670	neutral	Wiser souls would have tactfully pretended not to see it and left it lying there
4494	positive	A film of ideas and wry comic mayhem .
5267	positive	The problems and characters it reveals are universal and involving , and the film itself -- as well its delightful cast -- is so breezy , pretty and gifted , it really won my heart .
3343	positive	Cusack 's just brilliant in this .
3325	negative	Humorless , self-conscious art drivel , made without a glimmer of intelligence or invention .
5711	positive	A fascinating , unnerving examination of the delusions of one unstable man .
1828	negative	The movie 's major and most devastating flaw is its reliance on formula , though , and it 's quite enough to lessen the overall impact the movie could have had .
5707	negative	-LRB- The film 's -RRB- taste for `` shock humor '' will wear thin on all but those weaned on the comedy of Tom Green and the Farrelly Brothers .
724	positive	Really is a pan-American movie , with moments of genuine insight into the urban heart .
5387	negative	It 's mildly interesting to ponder the peculiar American style of justice that plays out here , but it 's so muddled and derivative that few will bother thinking it all through .
5593	negative	A sham construct based on theory , sleight-of-hand , and ill-wrought hypothesis .
4080	negative	Plot , characters , drama , emotions , ideas -- all are irrelevant to the experience of seeing The Scorpion King .
6298	positive	The film 's appeal has a lot to do with the casting of Juliette Binoche as Sand , who brings to the role her pale , dark beauty and characteristic warmth .
915	neutral	If you adored The Full Monty so resoundingly that you 're dying to see the same old thing in a tired old setting , then this should keep you reasonably entertained .
5713	positive	This is unusual , food-for-thought cinema that 's as entertaining as it is instructive .
3762	positive	The world needs more filmmakers with passionate enthusiasms like Martin Scorsese .
1646	negative	Most of the problems with the film do n't derive from the screenplay , but rather the mediocre performances by most of the actors involved
8313	negative	Quite frankly , I ca n't see why any actor of talent would ever work in a McCulloch production again if they looked at how this movie turned out .
5620	negative	There 's not a spark of new inspiration in it , just more of the same , done with noticeably less energy and imagination .
3900	neutral	With one exception , every blighter in this particular South London housing project digs into dysfunction like it 's a big , comforting jar of Marmite , to be slathered on crackers and served as a feast of bleakness .
3554	positive	On its own staggeringly unoriginal terms , this gender-bending comedy is generally quite funny .
4786	negative	We ca n't accuse Kung Pow for misfiring , since it is exactly what it wants to be : an atrociously , mind-numbingly , indescribably bad movie .
2161	negative	The screenplay is hugely overwritten , with tons and tons of dialogue -- most of it given to children .
1134	negative	Ultimately too repellent to fully endear itself to American art house audiences , but it is notable for its stylistic austerity and forcefulness .
7406	positive	One fantastic -LRB- and educational -RRB- documentary .
2644	positive	A low-key labor of love that strikes a very resonant chord .
2759	negative	There is simply not enough of interest onscreen to sustain its seventy-minute running time .
6565	neutral	A farce of a parody of a comedy of a premise , it is n't a comparison to reality so much as it is a commentary about our knowledge of films .
5378	positive	If you come from a family that eats , meddles , argues , laughs , kibbitzes and fights together , then go see this delightful comedy .
3355	negative	Lacks the spirit of the previous two , and makes all those jokes about hos and even more unmentionable subjects seem like mere splashing around in the muck .
1266	positive	An intelligently made -LRB- and beautifully edited -RRB- picture that at the very least has a spark of life to it -- more than you can say for plenty of movies that flow through the Hollywood pipeline without a hitch .
831	positive	You need n't be steeped in '50s sociology , pop culture or movie lore to appreciate the emotional depth of Haynes ' work .
4091	positive	The picture 's fascinating byways are littered with trenchant satirical jabs at the peculiar egocentricities of the acting breed .
4552	negative	Could this be the first major studio production shot on video tape instead of film ?
444	positive	Evokes a palpable sense of disconnection , made all the more poignant by the incessant use of cell phones .
3080	positive	The film grows on you .
203	neutral	Being latently gay and liking to read are hardly enough .

5731	negative	A big fat pain .
4844	negative	Bad Company has one of the most moronic screenplays of the year , full of holes that will be obvious even to those who are n't looking for them .
3365	negative	An acceptable way to pass a little over an hour with moviegoers ages 8-10 , but it 's unlikely to inspire anything more than a visit to McDonald 's , let alone some savvy street activism .
8154	positive	Sorvino is delightful in the central role .
1519	negative	Yet another entry in the sentimental oh-those-wacky-Brits genre that was ushered in by The Full Monty and is still straining to produce another smash hit .

4262	negative	A small independent film suffering from a severe case of Hollywood-itis .
878	positive	The result is a powerful , naturally dramatic piece of low-budget filmmaking .
7771	positive	This ready-made midnight movie probably wo n't stand the cold light of day , but under the right conditions , it 's goofy -LRB- if not entirely wholesome -RRB- fun .
6704	positive	Much of the movie 's charm lies in the utter cuteness of Stuart and Margolo .
2956	positive	Peter Jackson has done the nearly impossible .
3096	neutral	It provides a grim , upsetting glimpse at the lives of some of the 1.2 million Palestinians who live in the crowded cities and refugee camps of Gaza .
1192	positive	The heat of the moment prevails .
1327	positive	At its best , this is grand-scale moviemaking for a larger-than-life figure , an artist who has been awarded mythic status in contemporary culture .
3255	positive	For those who pride themselves on sophisticated , discerning taste , this might not seem like the proper cup of tea , however it is almost guaranteed that even the stuffiest cinema goers will laugh their \*\*\* off for an hour-and-a-half .
2925	negative	The problem is the needlessly poor quality of its archival prints and film footage .
218	positive	An earnest , roughshod document , it serves as a workable primer for the region 's recent history , and would make a terrific 10th-grade learning tool .
6040	positive	A crisp psychological drama -LRB- and -RRB- a fascinating little thriller that would have been perfect for an old `` Twilight Zone '' episode .
4011	neutral	The action is reasonably well-done ... yet story , character and comedy bits are too ragged to ever fit smoothly together .
4441	positive	Hardly a film that comes along every day .
943	positive	This slight premise ... works because of the ideal casting of the masterful British actor Ian Holm as the aged Napoleon .
720	negative	Twenty-three movies into a mostly magnificent directorial career , Clint Eastwood 's efficiently minimalist style finally has failed him .
577	negative	We started to wonder if ... some unpaid intern had just typed ` Chris Rock , ' ` Anthony Hopkins ' and ` terrorists ' into some Univac-like script machine .
4654	neutral	But be warned , you too may feel time has decided to stand still .
4315	neutral	Though its atmosphere is intriguing ... the drama is finally too predictable to leave much of an impression .
4209	negative	Stitch is a bad mannered , ugly and destructive little \*\*\*\* .
211	positive	Damon brings the proper conviction to his role as -LRB- Jason Bourne -RRB- .
7983	negative	A mimetic approximation of better films
6822	negative	This action-thriller\/dark comedy is one of the most repellent things to pop up in a cinematic year already littered with celluloid garbage .
3093	negative	Nothing wrong with performances here , but the whiney characters bugged me .
2085	positive	Cut through the layers of soap-opera emotion and you find a scathing portrayal of a powerful entity strangling the life out of the people who want to believe in it the most .

1301	positive	there is truth here
1752	negative	One of these days Hollywood will come up with an original idea for a teen movie , but until then there 's always these rehashes to feed to the younger generations .
3694	positive	It 's fun , wispy , wise and surprisingly inoffensive for a film about a teen in love with his stepmom .

2845	positive	The script is smart , not cloying .
3518	negative	The skirmishes for power waged among victims and predators settle into an undistinguished rhythm of artificial suspense .
2878	negative	The bottom line , at least in my opinion , is Imposter makes a better short story than it does a film .
3661	positive	A headline-fresh thriller set among orthodox Jews on the West Bank , Joseph Cedar 's Time Of Favor manages not only to find a compelling dramatic means of addressing a complex situation , it does so without compromising that complexity .
6184	neutral	It just does n't have much else ... especially in a moral sense .
7482	positive	While the frequent allusions to gurus and doshas will strike some Westerners as verging on mumbo-jumbo ... broad streaks of common sense emerge with unimpeachable clarity .
2064	positive	Tunney , brimming with coltish , neurotic energy , holds the screen like a true star .
4118	negative	Unfortunately , One Hour Photo lives down to its title .
3929	negative	A culture clash comedy only half as clever as it thinks it is .
7056	neutral	Mushes the college-friends genre -LRB- The Big Chill -RRB- together with the contrivances and overwrought emotion of soap operas .
2332	negative	The whole thing 's fairly lame , making it par for the course for Disney sequels .
443	negative	Good-looking but relentlessly lowbrow outing plays like Clueless Does South Fork .
4828	neutral	Don Michael Paul uses quick-cuts , -LRB- very -RRB- large shadows and wide-angle shots taken from a distance to hide the liberal use of a body double -LRB- for Seagal -RRB- .
6206	neutral	Watching Spirited Away is like watching an Eastern imagination explode .
7077	negative	No new plot conceptions or environmental changes , just different bodies for sharp objects to rip through .
1257	neutral	Mostly the film is just hectic and homiletic : two parts exhausting Men in Black mayhem to one part family values .
5221	positive	may prove to be -LRB- Tsai 's -RRB- masterpiece .
1421	positive	Drumline is -- the mere suggestion , albeit a visually compelling one , of a fully realized story .
207	positive	It 's a fairy tale that comes from a renowned Indian film culture that allows Americans to finally revel in its splendor .
200	neutral	The movie 's heavy-handed screenplay navigates a fast fade into pomposity and pretentiousness .
7816	neutral	The filmmaker ascends , literally , to the Olympus of the art world , but he would have done well to end this flawed , dazzling series with the raising of something other than his own cremaster .
4120	neutral	Gere gives a good performance in a film that does n't merit it .
1062	negative	Bears is even worse than I imagined a movie ever could be .
2288	negative	When not wallowing in its characters ' frustrations , the movie is busy contriving false , sitcom-worthy solutions to their problems .
4070	positive	A riveting story well told .
1305	positive	While the path may be familiar , first-time director Denzel Washington and a top-notch cast manage to keep things interesting .
1883	negative	Throwing in everything except someone pulling the pin from a grenade with his teeth , Windtalkers seems to have ransacked every old World War II movie for overly familiar material .
1280	neutral	I wish Windtalkers had had more faith in the dramatic potential of this true story .
7686	negative	Instead of letting the laughs come as they may , Lawrence unleashes his trademark misogyny -- er , comedy -- like a human volcano or an overflowing septic tank , take your pick .
697	positive	This movie is to be cherished .
1726	positive	Even if the Naipaul original remains the real masterpiece , the movie possesses its own languorous charm .
4976	positive	` What 's the Russian word for Wow !? '
6558	positive	Simply and eloquently articulates the tangled feelings of particular New Yorkers deeply touched by an unprecedented tragedy .
5718	neutral	Please .
955	positive	... enthusiastically invokes the percussion rhythm , the brass soul and the sense of fierce competition that helps make great marching bands half the fun of college football games .
5607	positive	An affectionately goofy satire that 's unafraid to throw elbows when necessary ...
1898	positive	In the end there is one word that best describes this film : honest .
498	positive	She nearly glows with enthusiasm , sensuality and a conniving wit .
1867	positive	The movie itself is far from disappointing , offering an original take on courtroom movies , a few nifty twists that are so crucial to the genre and another first-rate performance by top-billed star Bruce Willis .
7439	positive	Like Vardalos and Corbett , who play their roles with vibrant charm , the film , directed by Joel Zwick , is heartfelt and hilarious in ways you ca n't fake .
5938	neutral	Underachieves only in not taking the Shakespeare parallels quite far enough .
1146	negative	One of the most plain , unimaginative romantic comedies I 've ever seen .
3237	neutral	It may sound like a mere disease-of - the-week TV movie , but A Song For Martin is made infinitely more wrenching by the performances of real-life spouses Seldahl and Wollter .
8256	neutral	Big time .
1878	negative	Gooding and Coburn are both Oscar winners , a fact which , as you watch them clumsily mugging their way through Snow Dogs , seems inconceivable .
204	positive	More sophisticated and literate than such pictures usually are ... an amusing little catch .
5406	positive	This is a visually stunning rumination on love , memory , history and the war between art and commerce .
7388	negative	Sad nonsense , this .
7760	positive	If you like quirky , odd movies and\/or the ironic , here 's a fun one .
5785	negative	Contrived , awkward and filled with unintended laughs , the film shows signs that someone other than the director got into the editing room and tried to improve things by making the movie go faster .
1672	positive	Efficient , suitably anonymous chiller .
279	negative	Festers in just such a dungpile that you 'd swear you were watching monkeys flinging their feces at you .
6403	negative	McKay seems embarrassed by his own invention and tries to rush through the intermediary passages , apparently hoping that the audience will not notice the glaring triteness of the plot device he has put in service .
3363	positive	Amari has dressed up this little parable in a fairly irresistible package full of privileged moments and memorable performances .
5286	neutral	De Niro cries .
6577	neutral	At the film 's centre is a precisely layered performance by an actor in his mid-seventies , Michel Piccoli .
4666	positive	One of the best movies of the year .
7027	negative	Everything is off .
7815	negative	Like most movies about the pitfalls of bad behavior ... Circuit gets drawn into the party .
3311	negative	The somber pacing and lack of dramatic fireworks make Green Dragon seem more like medicine than entertainment .
7291	negative	Like a soft drink that 's been sitting open too long : it 's too much syrup and not enough fizz .
2670	negative	But this new jangle of noise , mayhem and stupidity must be a serious contender for the title .
5679	positive	Fantastic !
6317	negative	Do we really need another film that praises female self-sacrifice ?
231	neutral	Williams plays Sy , another of his open-faced , smiling madmen , like the killer in Insomnia .
4946	negative	Aside from the fact that the film idiotically uses the website feardotcom.com or the improperly hammy performance from poor Stephen Rea , the film gets added disdain for the fact that it is nearly impossible to look at or understand .
401	neutral	A porn film without the sex scenes .
6268	positive	A forceful drama of an alienated executive who re-invents himself .
6517	positive	There 's nothing like love to give a movie a B-12 shot , and CQ shimmers with it .
7876	neutral	The faithful will enjoy this sometimes wry adaptation of V.S. Naipaul 's novel , but newcomers may find themselves stifling a yawn or two during the first hour .
1683	positive	Represents a worthy departure from the culture clash comedies that have marked an emerging Indian American cinema .
7651	positive	The trailer is a riot .
6772	negative	Demme gets a lot of flavor and spice into his Charade remake , but he ca n't disguise that he 's spiffing up leftovers that are n't so substantial or fresh .
2224	negative	Try this obscenely bad dark comedy , so crass that it makes Edward Burns ' Sidewalks of New York look like Oscar Wilde .
7661	neutral	While we want MacDowell 's character to retrieve her husband , we have to ask whether her personal odyssey trumps the carnage that claims so many lives around her .
6003	negative	Comes off more like a misdemeanor , a flat , unconvincing drama that never catches fire .
3473	neutral	-LRB- The digital effects -RRB- reminded me of Terry Gilliam 's rudimentary old Monty Python cartoons , in which he would cut out figures from drawings and photographs and paste them together .
1712	positive	An elegant work , Food of Love is as consistently engaging as it is revealing .
7531	negative	During The Tuxedo 's 90 minutes of screen time , there is n't one true ` Chan moment ' .
6826	neutral	Avary 's film never quite emerges from the shadow of Ellis ' book .
421	positive	It 's a powerful though flawed movie , guaranteed to put a lump in your throat while reaffirming Washington as possibly the best actor working in movies today .
8069	positive	The AAA of action , XXX is a blast of adrenalin , rated EEE for excitement .
4054	negative	You leave feeling like you 've endured a long workout without your pulse ever racing .
4621	positive	Greg Kinnear gives a mesmerizing performance as a full-fledged sex addict who is in complete denial about his obsessive behavior .

3046	negative	Co-writer\/director Jonathan Parker 's attempts to fashion a Brazil-like , hyper-real satire fall dreadfully short .
4271	positive	But it is entertaining on an inferior level .
114	positive	Whenever it threatens to get bogged down in earnest dramaturgy , a stirring visual sequence like a surge through swirling rapids or a leap from pinnacle to pinnacle rouses us .
1838	positive	The trick when watching Godard is to catch the pitch of his poetics , savor the pleasure of his sounds and images , and ponder the historical , philosophical , and ethical issues that intersect with them .
6219	neutral	Denver should not get the first and last look at one of the most triumphant performances of Vanessa Redgrave 's career .
1757	neutral	Exactly what you 'd expect from a guy named Kaos .
5864	negative	Mattei 's underdeveloped effort here is nothing but a convenient conveyor belt of brooding personalities that parade about as if they were coming back from Stock Character camp -- a drowsy drama infatuated by its own pretentious self-examination .
8288	positive	Renner carries much of the film with a creepy and dead-on performance .
2226	negative	Human Nature , in short , is n't nearly as funny as it thinks it is ; neither is it as smart .
324	positive	A dreadful day in Irish history is given passionate , if somewhat flawed , treatment .
6328	positive	That rare film whose real-life basis is , in fact , so interesting that no embellishment is needed .
7185	positive	A vibrant , colorful , semimusical rendition .
2480	negative	But it 's also disappointing to a certain degree .
2151	negative	Obviously , a lot of people wasted a lot of their time -LRB- including mine -RRB- on something very inconsequential .
2091	neutral	while -LRB- Roman Coppola -RRB- scores points for style , he staggers in terms of story .
778	positive	A small movie with a big heart .
6781	negative	It 's a stale , overused cocktail using the same olives since 1962 as garnish .
6490	negative	The story has its redundancies , and the young actors , not very experienced , are sometimes inexpressive .
7734	negative	A seriously bad film with seriously warped logic by writer-director Kurt Wimmer at the screenplay level .
5933	negative	It makes even Elizabeth Hurley seem graceless and ugly .
2886	negative	Cattaneo reworks the formula that made The Full Monty a smashing success ... but neglects to add the magic that made it all work .
5651	positive	Walter Hill 's Undisputed is like a 1940s Warner Bros. .
1142	positive	Discursive but oddly riveting documentary .
1781	negative	What starts off as a potentially incredibly twisting mystery becomes simply a monster chase film .
1732	negative	It 's just merely very bad .
4838	negative	The predominantly amateur cast is painful to watch , so stilted and unconvincing are the performances .
6165	positive	Nice piece of work .
8047	positive	The engagingly primitive animated special effects contribute to a mood that 's sustained through the surprisingly somber conclusion .
299	negative	A dreary movie .
8441	positive	Nonchalantly freaky and uncommonly pleasurable , Warm Water may well be the year 's best and most unpredictable comedy .
1770	neutral	A fantastic premise anchors this movie , but what it needs is either a more rigid , Blair Witch-style commitment to its mockumentary format , or a more straightforward , dramatic treatment , with all the grandiosity that that implies .
4375	positive	There 's much tongue in cheek in the film and there 's no doubt the filmmaker is having fun with it all .
1835	positive	Intriguing and stylish .
1542	positive	Like Kissing Jessica Stein , Amy 's Orgasm has a key strength in its willingness to explore its principal characters with honesty , insight and humor .

8003	neutral	Circuit queens wo n't learn a thing , they 'll be too busy cursing the film 's strategically placed white sheets .
6959	negative	With a romantic comedy plotline straight from the ages , this Cinderella story does n't have a single surprise up its sleeve .
508	negative	But its storytelling prowess and special effects are both listless .
6867	negative	-LRB- T -RRB- his slop does n't even have potential as a cult film , as it 's too loud to shout insults at the screen .
6813	positive	The story gives ample opportunity for large-scale action and suspense , which director Shekhar Kapur supplies with tremendous skill .
6189	positive	... there is enough originality in ` Life ' to distance it from the pack of paint-by-number romantic comedies that so often end up on cinema screens .

8279	positive	Shot largely in small rooms , the film has a gentle , unforced intimacy that never becomes claustrophobic .
7209	negative	-LRB- L -RRB- ame and unnecessary .
6176	positive	The solid filmmaking and convincing characters makes this a high water mark for this genre .
5473	positive	Splendidly illustrates the ability of the human spirit to overcome adversity .
8093	positive	A modestly made but profoundly moving documentary .
8223	negative	Average , at best , I 'm afraid .
1697	positive	A raunchy and frequently hilarious follow-up to the gifted Korean American stand-up 's I 'm the One That I Want .
3779	positive	Amid the new populist comedies that underscore the importance of family tradition and familial community , one would be hard-pressed to find a movie with a bigger , fatter heart than Barbershop .
517	positive	An intelligent , multi-layered and profoundly humanist -LRB- not to mention gently political -RRB- meditation on the values of knowledge , education , and the affects of cultural and geographical displacement .
6836	positive	10 minutes into the film you 'll be white-knuckled and unable to look away .
2737	neutral	Shadyac , who belongs with the damned for perpetrating Patch Adams , trots out every ghost trick from The Sixth Sense to The Mothman Prophecies .
7184	negative	A DOA dud from frame one .
5124	negative	Feeble comedy .
2614	negative	This starts off with a 1950 's Doris Day feel and it gets very ugly , very fast .
6998	positive	The magic -LRB- and original running time -RRB- of ace Japanimator Hayao Miyazaki 's Spirited Away survives intact in BV 's re-voiced version .
2750	negative	The modern-day royals have nothing on these guys when it comes to scandals .
5764	negative	But unless you 're an absolute raving Star Wars junkie , it is n't much fun .
5720	neutral	No matter how you slice it , Mark Wahlberg and Thandie Newton are not Hepburn and Grant , two cinematic icons with chemistry galore .
2609	positive	A minor film with major pleasures from Portuguese master Manoel de Oliviera ...
6775	positive	Moving and vibrant .
1761	neutral	Only two-fifths of a satisfying movie experience .
7626	positive	Very amusing , not the usual route in a thriller , and the performances are odd and pixilated and sometimes both .
2675	positive	My Wife Is an Actress works as well as it does because -LRB- the leads -RRB- are such a companionable couple .
5926	positive	Secretary is just too original to be ignored .
2504	positive	It 's a masterpeice .
5147	positive	Manages to delight without much of a story .
7407	positive	... an interesting slice of history .
7068	neutral	Overall , it 's a wacky and inspired little film that works effortlessly at delivering genuine , acerbic laughs .

1125	positive	A buoyant romantic comedy about friendship , love , and the truth that we 're all in this together .
8157	positive	Exhilarating but blatantly biased .
6064	negative	Complex , sinuously plotted and , somehow , off-puttingly cold .
6378	positive	brought to life on the big screen .
8070	negative	What remains is a variant of the nincompoop Benigni persona , here a more annoying , though less angry version of the irresponsible Sandlerian manchild , undercut by the voice of the star of Road Trip .
6595	negative	Opera on film is never satisfactory .
7218	positive	The film is insightful about Kissinger 's background and history .
7960	neutral	Call this The Full Monty on ice , the underdog sports team formula redux .
6845	positive	Once folks started hanging out at the barbershop , they never wanted to leave .
4810	negative	Reggio and Glass so rhapsodize cynicism , with repetition and languorous slo-mo sequences , that Glass 's dirgelike score becomes a fang-baring lullaby .
4109	negative	It gets old quickly .
5806	negative	It 's got the brawn , but not the brains .
3787	neutral	Muddled , trashy and incompetent
6103	negative	But even then , I 'd recommend waiting for DVD and just skipping straight to her scenes .
1481	negative	There 's an excellent 90-minute film here ; unfortunately , it runs for 170 .
7602	positive	The extent to which it succeeds is impressive .
7126	negative	The characters seem one-dimensional , and the film is superficial and will probably be of interest primarily to its target audience .
1052	positive	finely crafted , finely written , exquisitely performed
7483	positive	Old-fashioned but thoroughly satisfying entertainment .
1480	positive	Weighty and ponderous but every bit as filling as the treat of the title .
1467	negative	It 's crap on a leash -- far too polite to scale the lunatic heights of Joe Dante 's similarly styled Gremlins .
2043	neutral	Viewed as a comedy , a romance , a fairy tale , or a drama , there 's nothing remotely triumphant about this motion picture .
8459	positive	Competently directed but terminally cute drama .
7707	positive	The gags are often a stitch .
1274	positive	A college story that works even without vulgarity , sex scenes , and cussing !
5191	negative	This is a movie that starts out like Heathers , then becomes Bring it On , then becomes unwatchable .
907	positive	Somehow Ms. Griffiths and Mr. Pryce bring off this wild Welsh whimsy .
7759	negative	The whole mess boils down to a transparently hypocritical work that feels as though it 's trying to set the women 's liberation movement back 20 years . '
5621	negative	Murphy and Wilson actually make a pretty good team ... but the project surrounding them is distressingly rote .
6860	positive	It 's not like having a real film of Nijinsky , but at least it 's better than that eponymous 1980 biopic that used soap in the places where the mysteries lingered .
3738	positive	Director Nancy Savoca 's no-frills record of a show forged in still-raw emotions captures the unsettled tenor of that post 9-11 period far better than a more measured or polished production ever could .
5505	neutral	Sometimes entertaining , sometimes indulgent -- but never less than pure wankery .
3904	negative	Chan 's stunts are limited and so embellished by editing that there 's really not much of a sense of action or even action-comedy .
7610	positive	It 's soulful and unslick , and that 's apparently just what -LRB- Aniston -RRB- has always needed to grow into a movie career .
2401	positive	An intelligent and deeply felt work about impossible , irrevocable choices and the price of making them .
1775	neutral	`` Not really as bad as you might think ! ''
8447	positive	Shot in rich , shadowy black-and-white , Devils chronicles , with increasingly amused irony , the relationship between reluctant captors and befuddled captives .
1753	positive	A wild ride juiced with enough energy and excitement for at least three films .
1176	positive	It 's still a comic book , but Maguire makes it a comic book with soul .
2962	negative	But for the most part , The Weight of Water comes off as a two-way time-switching myopic mystery that stalls in its lackluster gear of emotional blandness .
2410	neutral	Photographed with melancholy richness and eloquently performed yet also decidedly uncinematic .
8216	negative	I have to admit I walked out of Runteldat .
118	positive	300 years of Russian history and culture compressed into an evanescent , seamless and sumptuous stream of consciousness .
5809	negative	The slapstick is labored , and the bigger setpieces flat .
2947	neutral	Just entertaining enough not to hate , too mediocre to love .
3349	negative	... the cast portrays their cartoon counterparts well ... but quite frankly , Scoob and Shag do n't eat enough during the film . '
2612	positive	-LRB- Gayton 's script -RRB- telegraphs every discovery and layers on the gloss of convenience .
5661	positive	An interesting psychological game of cat-and-mouse , three-dimensional characters and believable performances all add up to a satisfying crime drama .
4175	negative	It 's rare to see a movie that takes such a speedy swan dive from `` promising '' to `` interesting '' to `` familiar '' before landing squarely on `` stupid '' .
2008	negative	What happens when something goes bump in the night and nobody cares ?
6032	negative	an essentially awkward version of the lightweight female empowerment picture we 've been watching for decades

7132	neutral	There 's something about a marching band that gets me where I live .
2752	positive	Not as well-written as Sexy Beast , not as gloriously flippant as Lock , Stock and Two Smoking Barrels , but stylish and moody and exceptionally well-acted .

1823	negative	This 10th film in the series looks and feels tired .
4827	positive	A huge box-office hit in Korea , Shiri is a must for genre fans .
7550	positive	It 's weird , wonderful , and not necessarily for kids .
8019	positive	Rodriguez has the chops of a smart-aleck film school brat and the imagination of a big kid ...
3549	neutral	By the time it ends in a rush of sequins , flashbulbs , blaring brass and back-stabbing babes , it has said plenty about how show business has infiltrated every corner of society -- and not always for the better .
3838	positive	The movie 's thesis -- elegant technology for the masses -- is surprisingly refreshing .
1743	negative	They just have problems , which are neither original nor are presented in convincing way .
7177	negative	The lack of naturalness makes everything seem self-consciously poetic and forced ... It 's a pity that -LRB- Nelson 's -RRB- achievement does n't match his ambition .
2294	negative	An impenetrable and insufferable ball of pseudo-philosophic twaddle .
4904	positive	Though its rather routine script is loaded with familiar situations , the movie has a cinematic fluidity and sense of intelligence that makes it work more than it probably should .
3050	negative	Like an Afterschool Special with costumes by Gianni Versace , Mad Love looks better than it feels .
5399	negative	Full Frontal had no effect and elicited no sympathies for any of the characters .
7698	negative	Forages for audience sympathy like a temperamental child begging for attention , giving audiences no reason to truly care for its decrepit freaks beyond the promise of a reprieve from their incessant whining .
7449	positive	Overcomes its visual hideousness with a sharp script and strong performances .
4634	negative	Memorable for a peculiar malaise that renders its tension flaccid and , by extension , its surprises limp and its resolutions ritual .
8269	negative	This is a movie where the most notable observation is how long you 've been sitting still .
8434	neutral	The strong subject matter continues to shock throughout the film .
3075	positive	At once disarmingly straightforward and strikingly devious .
1674	negative	The movie 's plot is almost entirely witless and inane , carrying every gag two or three times beyond its limit to sustain a laugh .
2928	positive	-LRB- While The Last Metro -RRB- was more melodramatic , confined to a single theater company and its strategies and deceptions , while Tavernier is more concerned with the entire period of history .
178	negative	Horrendously amateurish filmmaking that is plainly dull and visually ugly when it is n't incomprehensible .
3143	positive	A smart and funny , albeit sometimes superficial , cautionary tale of a technology in search of an artist .
8409	negative	Has nothing good to speak about other than the fact that it is relatively short , tries its best to hide the fact that Seagal 's overweight and out of shape .
4458	neutral	Especially compared with the television series that inspired the movie .
8514	negative	Every conceivable mistake a director could make in filming opera has been perpetrated here .
3183	positive	... a spoof comedy that carries its share of laughs -- sometimes a chuckle , sometimes a guffaw and , to my great pleasure , the occasional belly laugh .
8334	positive	A moving essay about the specter of death , especially suicide .
6683	positive	This is the stuff that Disney movies are made of .
1332	neutral	Renner ?
898	positive	-LRB- Ramsay -RRB- visually transforms the dreary expanse of dead-end distaste the characters inhabit into a poem of art , music and metaphor .

1706	neutral	It may not be `` Last Tango in Paris '' but ...
6659	positive	The cast is top-notch and I predict there will be plenty of female audience members drooling over Michael Idemoto as Michael .
5015	positive	It 's probably worth catching solely on its visual merits .
6806	positive	Seems based on ugly ideas instead of ugly behavior , as Happiness was ... Hence , Storytelling is far more appealing .
3619	positive	Aniston has at last decisively broken with her Friends image in an independent film of satiric fire and emotional turmoil .
3974	negative	The most horrific movie experience I 've had since `` Ca n't Stop The Music . ''
7464	positive	Although Estela Bravo 's documentary is cloyingly hagiographic in its portrait of Cuban leader Fidel Castro , it 's still a guilty pleasure to watch .
5974	neutral	Many shallower movies these days seem too long , but this one is egregiously short .
3592	negative	An empty shell of an epic rather than the real deal .
1020	positive	For every cheesy scene , though , there is a really cool bit -- the movie 's conception of a future-world holographic librarian -LRB- Orlando Jones -RRB- who knows everything and answers all questions , is visually smart , cleverly written , and nicely realized .
4410	positive	Much of All About Lily Chou-Chou is mesmerizing : some of its plaintiveness could make you weep .
484	neutral	As Warren he stumbles in search of all the emotions and life experiences he 's neglected over the years .
1797	negative	The film would have been more enjoyable had the balance shifted in favor of water-bound action over the land-based ` drama , ' but the emphasis on the latter leaves Blue Crush waterlogged .
4260	positive	The film was immensely enjoyable thanks to great performances by both Steve Buscemi and Rosario Dawson ...
7312	positive	A marvelous performance by Allison Lohman as an identity-seeking foster child .
7925	negative	What starts off as a satisfying kids flck becomes increasingly implausible as it races through contrived plot points .
3642	negative	The film runs on a little longer than it needs to -- Muccino either does n't notice when his story ends or just ca n't tear himself away from the characters -- but it 's smooth and professional .
6915	positive	Boomers and their kids will have a Barrie good time .
2435	neutral	The film has a childlike quality about it .
5113	negative	It is bad , but certainly not without merit as entertainment .
7811	negative	The film 's maudlin focus on the young woman 's infirmity and her naive dreams play like the worst kind of Hollywood heart-string plucking .
3267	neutral	What Bloody Sunday lacks in clarity , it makes up for with a great , fiery passion .
2283	positive	If you 're not , you 'll still have a good time . ''
3734	positive	Mama Africa pretty much delivers on that promise .
6536	negative	Two-bit potboiler .
4914	negative	Bottom-rung New Jack City wannabe .
1730	neutral	Or for the year , for that matter .
5303	negative	Murder by Numbers just does n't add up .
2144	positive	With the same sort of good-natured fun found in films like Tremors , Eight Legged Freaks is prime escapist fare .
8482	negative	We can tell what it is supposed to be , but ca n't really call it a work of art .
2560	positive	Visually captivating .
3122	positive	... with the gifted Pearce on hand to keep things on semi-stable ground dramatically , this retooled Machine is ultimately effective enough at achieving the modest , crowd-pleasing goals it sets for itself .
5311	positive	... spellbinding fun and deliciously exploitative .
4626	positive	Lan Yu is a genuine love story , full of traditional layers of awakening and ripening and separation and recovery .
1330	negative	A manipulative feminist empowerment tale thinly posing as a serious drama about spousal abuse .
531	positive	Combines improbable melodrama -LRB- gored bullfighters , comatose ballerinas -RRB- with subtly kinky bedside vigils and sensational denouements , and yet at the end , we are undeniably touched .
1659	positive	But it 's worth the concentration .
1888	negative	Star Trek was kind of terrific once , but now it is a copy of a copy of a copy .
3178	negative	The problem is that for the most part , the film is deadly dull .
3833	positive	Although some viewers will not be able to stomach so much tongue-in-cheek weirdness , those who do will have found a cult favorite to enjoy for a lifetime .
4875	negative	An instantly forgettable snow-and-stuntwork extravaganza that likely will be upstaged by an avalanche of more appealing holiday-season product .
6816	negative	It made me realize that we really have n't had a good cheesy B-movie playing in theaters since ... well ... since last week 's Reign of Fire .
57	negative	Run for your lives !
6091	positive	The story ultimately takes hold and grips hard .
6811	positive	It certainly wo n't win any awards in the plot department but it sets out with no pretensions and delivers big time .
4113	negative	It 's a long way from Orwell 's dark , intelligent warning cry -LRB- 1984 -RRB- to the empty stud knockabout of Equilibrium , and what once was conviction is now affectation .
3025	negative	This is one baaaaaaaaad movie .
718	negative	Pretend like your SAT scores are below 120 and you might not notice the flaws .
1983	negative	It 's an 88-minute highlight reel that 's 86 minutes too long .
3967	negative	Some Like It Hot on the Hardwood proves once again that a man in drag is not in and of himself funny .
620	positive	Muccino , who directed from his own screenplay , is a canny crowd pleaser , and The Last Kiss ... provides more than enough sentimental catharsis for a satisfying evening at the multiplex .
6312	neutral	To show these characters in the act and give them no feelings of remorse -- and to cut repeatedly to the flashback of the original rape -- is overkill to the highest degree .
3410	positive	Reign of Fire is hardly the most original fantasy film ever made -- beyond Road Warrior , it owes enormous debts to Aliens and every previous dragon drama -- but that barely makes it any less entertaining .
3975	neutral	Yet another self-consciously overwritten story about a rag-tag bunch of would-be characters that team up for a ca n't - miss heist -- only to have it all go wrong .
686	positive	It takes you somewhere you 're not likely to have seen before , but beneath the exotic surface -LRB- and exotic dancing -RRB- it 's surprisingly old-fashioned .
7470	positive	By the standards of knucklehead swill , The Hot Chick is pretty damned funny .
7419	negative	This is a film tailor-made for those who when they were in high school would choose the Cliff-Notes over reading a full-length classic .
1050	negative	Not only are the film 's Sopranos gags incredibly dated and unfunny , they also demonstrate how desperate the makers of this ` we 're - doing-it-for - the-cash ' sequel were .
889	negative	Irwin and his director never come up with an adequate reason why we should pay money for what we can get on television for free .
728	neutral	It 's exactly what you 'd expect .
2618	positive	If you 're a comic fan , you ca n't miss it .
5626	positive	It 's a lovely , eerie film that casts an odd , rapt spell .
4738	negative	Watching this film , what we feel is n't mainly suspense or excitement .
2711	neutral	Leading a double life in an American film only comes to no good , but not here .
704	negative	While it is interesting to witness the conflict from the Palestinian side , Longley 's film lacks balance ... and fails to put the struggle into meaningful historical context .
2768	neutral	It wo n't harm anyone , but neither can I think of a very good reason to rush right out and see it .
4464	positive	An encouraging effort from McCrudden
3383	negative	Merely -LRB- and literally -RRB- tosses around sex toys and offers half-hearted paeans to empowerment that are repeatedly undercut by the brutality of the jokes , most at women 's expense .
730	negative	You can not guess why the cast and crew did n't sign a pact to burn the negative and the script and pretend the whole thing never existed .
4832	neutral	Instead , he focuses on the anguish that can develop when one mulls leaving the familiar to traverse uncharted ground .
2300	neutral	The movie 's gloomy atmosphere is fascinating , though , even if the movie itself does n't stand a ghost of a chance .
959	positive	The real star of this movie is the score , as in the songs translate well to film , and it 's really well directed .
3162	negative	While the transgressive trappings -LRB- especially the frank sex scenes -RRB- ensure that the film is never dull , Rodrigues 's beast-within metaphor is ultimately rather silly and overwrought , making the ambiguous ending seem goofy rather than provocative .
1582	negative	Apparently designed as a reverie about memory and regret , but the only thing you 'll regret is remembering the experience of sitting through it .
1328	positive	Funny in a sick , twisted sort of way .
3329	negative	All comedy is subversive , but this unrelenting bleak insistence on opting out of any opportunity for finding meaning in relationships or work just becomes sad .
5723	positive	If you 're looking for an intelligent movie in which you can release your pent up anger , ENOUGH is just the ticket you need .
1588	negative	... has about 3\/4th the fun of its spry 2001 predecessor -- but it 's a rushed , slapdash , sequel-for-the-sake - of-a-sequel with less than half the plot and ingenuity .
3600	neutral	A thunderous ride at first , quiet cadences of pure finesse are few and far between ; their shortage dilutes the potency of otherwise respectable action .
355	positive	Too clever by about nine-tenths .
2175	neutral	Aimed squarely at the least demanding of demographic groups : very small children who will be delighted simply to spend more time with familiar cartoon characters .
5111	negative	Aan opportunity wasted .
7670	positive	The film is small in scope , yet perfectly formed .
7515	negative	The drama was so uninspiring that even a story immersed in love , lust , and sin could n't keep my attention .
8282	positive	... the plot weaves us into a complex web .
454	negative	Like most of Jaglom 's films , some of it is honestly affecting , but more of it seems contrived and secondhand .
5826	neutral	It 's a boom-box of a movie that might have been titled ` The Loud and the Ludicrous ' ... the pandering to a moviegoing audience dominated by young males is all too calculated .
7604	neutral	Like other great documentaries ... this goes after one truth -LRB- the Ford administration 's complicity in tearing ` orphans ' from their mothers -RRB- and stumbles upon others even more compelling .
115	negative	Swinging , the film makes it seem , is not a hobby that attracts the young and fit .
4361	positive	Polished , well-structured film .
1544	negative	As predictable as the outcome of a Globetrotters-Generals game , Juwanna Mann is even more ludicrous than you 'd expect from the guy-in-a-dress genre , and a personal low for everyone involved .
6730	neutral	A. . .
8430	neutral	A good-looking but ultimately pointless political thriller with plenty of action and almost no substance .
5798	negative	An ugly-duckling tale so hideously and clumsily told it feels accidental .
5133	positive	All three women deliver remarkable performances .
4132	negative	Just is n't as weird as it ought to be .
3082	negative	Allegiance to Chekhov , which director Michael Cacoyannis displays with somber earnestness in the new adaptation of The Cherry Orchard , is a particularly vexing handicap .
3861	positive	A comedy that is warm , inviting , and surprising .
7157	positive	Very predictable but still entertaining
4449	positive	All in all , an interesting look at the life of the campaign-trail press , especially ones that do n't really care for the candidate they 're forced to follow .
1825	negative	Cherish is a dud -- a romantic comedy that 's not the least bit romantic and only mildly funny .
1595	positive	Should be required viewing for civics classes and would-be public servants alike .
6524	positive	If anything , the film is doing something of a public service -- shedding light on a group of extremely talented musicians who might otherwise go unnoticed and underappreciated by music fans .
3413	negative	90 punitive minutes of eardrum-dicing gunplay , screeching-metal smashups , and flaccid odd-couple sniping .
6158	negative	Despite the fact that this film was n't as bad as I thought it was going to be , it 's still not a good movie
1995	negative	An empty , purposeless exercise .
1954	positive	An edifying glimpse into the wit and revolutionary spirit of these performers and their era .
4578	positive	The film has the high-buffed gloss and high-octane jolts you expect of De Palma , but what makes it transporting is that it 's also one of the smartest , most pleasurable expressions of pure movie love to come from an American director in years .
6278	positive	An entertaining , if somewhat standardized , action movie .
4014	positive	McGrath has deftly trimmed Dickens ' wonderfully sprawling soap opera , the better to focus on the hero 's odyssey from cowering poverty to courage and happiness .
2388	negative	As gamely as the movie tries to make sense of its title character , there remains a huge gap between the film 's creepy , clean-cut Dahmer -LRB- Jeremy Renner -RRB- and fiendish acts that no amount of earnest textbook psychologizing can bridge .
4193	positive	-LRB- Breheny 's -RRB- lensing of the New Zealand and Cook Island locations captures both the beauty of the land and the people .
2941	negative	As pure over-the-top trash , any John Waters movie has it beat by a country mile .
752	negative	The movie is loaded with good intentions , but in his zeal to squeeze the action and our emotions into the all-too-familiar dramatic arc of the Holocaust escape story , Minac drains his movie of all individuality .
361	positive	Bigelow offers some flashy twists and turns that occasionally fortify this turgid fable .
3130	positive	Frequent flurries of creative belly laughs and genuinely enthusiastic performances ... keep the movie slaloming through its hackneyed elements with enjoyable ease .
2733	neutral	Lillard and Cardellini earn their Scooby Snacks , but not anyone else .
6796	negative	It 's a frightful vanity film that , no doubt , pays off what debt Miramax felt they owed to Benigni .
5223	neutral	Dense and enigmatic ... elusive ... stagy and stilted
2884	positive	Frank Capra played this story straight .
7133	positive	Serious movie-goers embarking upon this journey will find that The Road to Perdition leads to a satisfying destination .
5637	positive	That Storytelling has value can not be denied .
8462	negative	Feels less like a change in -LRB- Herzog 's -RRB- personal policy than a half-hearted fluke .
7244	positive	Just like a splendid meal , Red Dragon satisfies -- from its ripe recipe , inspiring ingredients , certified cuisine and palatable presentation .
942	neutral	Sheridan
386	negative	Trying to figure out the rules of the Country Bear universe -- when are bears bears and when are they like humans , only hairier -- would tax Einstein 's brain .
606	neutral	Though Haynes ' style apes films from the period ... its message is not rooted in that decade .
436	negative	The rollerball sequences feel sanitised and stagey .
1814	positive	Saddled with an unwieldy cast of characters and angles , but the payoff is powerful and revelatory .

5689	positive	Some remarkable achival film about how Shanghai -LRB- of all places -RRB- served Jews who escaped the Holocaust .
3550	neutral	Holds limited appeal to those who like explosions , sadism and seeing people beat each other to a pulp .

2045	positive	A special kind of movie , this melancholic film noir reminded me a lot of Memento ...
3938	negative	-LRB- Swimfan -RRB- falls victim to sloppy plotting , an insultingly unbelievable final act and a villainess who is too crazy to be interesting .
2608	negative	The movie is so contrived , nonsensical and formulaic that , come to think of it , the day-old shelf would be a more appropriate location to store it .
4834	positive	It 's stylishly directed with verve ...
6271	positive	The Woodman seems to have directly influenced this girl-meets-girl love story , but even more reassuring is how its makers actually seem to understand what made Allen 's romantic comedies so pertinent and enduring .
7809	negative	Slap me , I saw this movie .
5356	negative	A worthy idea , but the uninspired scripts , acting and direction never rise above the level of an after-school TV special .

8312	negative	`` The Adventures of Pluto Nash '' is a big time stinker .
7075	positive	It 's hard to imagine anybody ever being `` in the mood '' to view a movie as harrowing and painful as The Grey Zone , but it 's equally hard to imagine anybody being able to tear their eyes away from the screen once it 's started .
6767	neutral	The message of such reflections -- intentional or not -- is that while no art grows from a vacuum , many artists exist in one .
5462	positive	Adaptation is simply brilliant .
5551	negative	I found the movie as divided against itself as the dysfunctional family it portrays .
8487	positive	And we do n't avert our eyes for a moment .
3596	positive	Juliette Binoche 's Sand is vivacious , but it 's hard to sense that powerhouse of 19th-century prose behind her childlike smile .

2799	negative	Shunji Iwai 's All About Lily Chou Chou is a beautifully shot , but ultimately flawed film about growing up in Japan .
7589	positive	More timely than its director could ever have dreamed , this quietly lyrical tale probes the ambiguous welcome extended by Iran to the Afghani refugees who streamed across its borders , desperate for work and food .
6112	negative	Should have gone straight to video .
3108	neutral	Here 's my advice , Kev .
7023	negative	Unlike Trey Parker , Sandler does n't understand that the idea of exploiting molestation for laughs is funny , not actually exploiting it yourself .
7113	neutral	Much of the digitally altered footage

783	neutral	Disney aficionados will notice distinct parallels between this story and the 1971 musical `` Bedknobs and Broomsticks , '' which also dealt with British children rediscovering the power of fantasy during wartime .
1248	negative	Plodding , poorly written , murky and weakly acted , the picture feels as if everyone making it lost their movie mojo .
3120	negative	The movie is so resolutely cobbled together out of older movies that it even uses a totally unnecessary prologue , just because it seems obligatory .

5225	positive	May lack the pungent bite of its title , but it 's an enjoyable trifle nonetheless .
745	negative	No , even that 's too committed .

5567	positive	-LRB- P -RRB- artnering Murphy with Robert De Niro for the TV-cops comedy Showtime would seem to be surefire casting .

91	neutral	It 's lazy for a movie to avoid solving one problem by trying to distract us with the solution to another .
3982	positive	The story line may be 127 years old , but El Crimen del Padre Amaro ... could n't be more timely in its despairing vision of corruption within the Catholic establishment .

2006	negative	Empire ca n't make up its mind whether it wants to be a gangster flick or an art film .
795	positive	A well-executed spy-thriller .
7677	positive	This cinema verite speculation on the assassination of John F. Kennedy may have been inspired by Blair Witch , but it takes its techniques into such fresh territory that the film never feels derivative .
8511	positive	Much has been written about those years when the psychedelic '60s grooved over into the gay '70s , but words do n't really do the era justice .

1171	negative	A surprisingly flat retread , hobbled by half-baked setups and sluggish pacing .
7050	negative	MIB II is a movie that makes it possible for the viewer to doze off for a few minutes or make several runs to the concession stand and\/or restroom and not feel as if he or she has missed anything .
1081	negative	For a story set at sea , Ghost Ship is pretty landbound , with its leaden acting , dull exposition and telegraphed ` surprises . '

161	negative	The story alone could force you to scratch a hole in your head .
5591	positive	Ben Kingsley is truly funny , playing a kind of Ghandi gone bad .

8361	negative	If you value your time and money , find an escape clause and avoid seeing this trite , predictable rehash .
1866	negative	The appeal of the vulgar , sexist , racist humour went over my head or -- considering just how low brow it is -- perhaps it snuck under my feet .
5928	negative	What should have been a cutting Hollywood satire is instead about as fresh as last week 's issue of Variety .
7095	neutral	In both the writing and cutting , it does not achieve the kind of dramatic unity that transports you .
7442	negative	... a pretentious and ultimately empty examination of a sick and evil woman .
134	negative	It 's hard to say who might enjoy this , are there Tolstoy groupies out there ?

7066	positive	A harrowing account of a psychological breakdown .
5431	positive	The year 2002 has conjured up more coming-of-age stories than seem possible , but Take Care of My Cat emerges as the very best of them .

4830	positive	A wonderful , ghastly film .
8257	negative	I wish it would have just gone more over-the-top instead of trying to have it both ways .

578	positive	Mostly works because of the universal themes , earnest performances ... and excellent use of music by India 's popular Gulzar and Jagjit Singh .
8084	negative	No amount of arty theorizing -- the special effects are ` German-Expressionist , ' according to the press notes -- can render it anything but laughable .
1094	negative	Despite its Hawaiian setting , the science-fiction trimmings and some moments of rowdy slapstick , the basic plot of `` Lilo '' could have been pulled from a tear-stained vintage Shirley Temple script .
6833	positive	Yes , MIBII is rote work and predictable , but with a philosophical visual coming right at the end that extravagantly redeems it .
2939	negative	If there was ever a movie where the upbeat ending feels like a copout , this is the one .
7700	positive	It 's neither as sappy as Big Daddy nor as anarchic as Happy Gilmore or The Waterboy , but it has its moments .

1419	negative	Wendigo wants to be a monster movie for the art-house crowd , but it falls into the trap of pretention almost every time .
4438	positive	A bittersweet drama about the limbo of grief and how truth-telling can open the door to liberation .
5093	positive	Canada 's arctic light shines bright on this frozen tundra soap opera that breathes extraordinary life into the private existence of the Inuit people .
7200	positive	A sensitive , modest comic tragedy that works as both character study and symbolic examination of the huge economic changes sweeping modern China .
6076	positive	The Saigon of 1952 is an uneasy mix of sensual delights and simmering violence , and The Quiet American brings us right into the center of that world .
986	negative	Alternative medicine obviously has its merits ... but Ayurveda does the field no favors .
3519	negative	It 's hard to believe these jokers are supposed to have pulled off four similar kidnappings before .
5038	neutral	OK arthouse .

1000	negative	Action - mechanical .
365	negative	The movie resolutely avoids all the comic possibilities of its situation , and becomes one more dumb high school comedy about sex gags and prom dates .
7768	negative	Unfortunately , Kapur modernizes A.E.W. Mason 's story to suit the sensibilities of a young American , a decision that plucks `` The Four Feathers '' bare .
4099	negative	What we have is a character faced with the possibility that her life is meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance , in a movie that is definitely meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance .
494	neutral	A subtle , poignant picture of goodness that is flawed , compromised and sad .
2087	neutral	It understands , in a way that speaks forcefully enough about the mechanisms of poverty to transcend the rather simplistic filmmaking .
2905	negative	Whatever the movie 's sentimental , hypocritical lessons about sexism , its true colors come out in various wet T-shirt and shower scenes .
6954	neutral	It 's like an old Warner Bros. costumer jived with sex -- this could be the movie Errol Flynn always wanted to make , though Bette Davis , cast as Joan , would have killed him .
3157	negative	The movie is virtually without context -- journalistic or historical .
6016	neutral	A brain twister , less a movie-movie than a funny and weird meditation on Hollywood , success , artistic integrity and intellectual bankruptcy .
7313	positive	In fact , it 's quite fun in places .
4059	negative	The movie has a script -LRB- by Paul Pender -RRB- made of wood , and it 's relentlessly folksy , a procession of stagy set pieces stacked with binary oppositions .
7880	negative	Diaz wears out her welcome in her most charmless performance
4672	positive	Despite a quieter middle section , involving Aragorn 's dreams of Arwen , this is even better than The Fellowship .
5281	negative	But seriously , folks , it does n't work .
87	positive	Highly recommended viewing for its courage , ideas , technical proficiency and great acting .
1373	negative	There are now two signs that M. Night Shyamalan 's debut feature sucked up all he has to give to the mystic genres of cinema : Unbreakable and Signs .
5009	positive	Implicitly acknowledges and celebrates the glorious chicanery and self-delusion of this most American of businesses , and for that reason it may be the most oddly honest Hollywood document of all .
6593	positive	Stay for the credits and see a devastating comic impersonation by Dustin Hoffman that is revelatory .
7936	negative	Medem may have disrobed most of the cast , leaving their bodies exposed , but the plot remains as guarded as a virgin with a chastity belt .
5391	negative	Not really a thriller so much as a movie for teens to laugh , groan and hiss at .
4537	negative	The problem is that the movie has no idea of it is serious or not .
5410	negative	` Dragonfly ' dwells on crossing-over mumbo jumbo , manipulative sentimentality , and sappy dialogue .

7866	negative	In other words , about as bad a film you 're likely to see all year .
6892	positive	I liked it because it was so endlessly , grotesquely , inventive .
1591	negative	A cellophane-pop remake of the punk classic Ladies and Gentlemen , The Fabulous Stains ... Crossroads is never much worse than bland or better than inconsequential .
4522	positive	Savvy director Robert J. Siegel and his co-writers keep the story subtle and us in suspense .
6085	positive	A genuinely moving and wisely unsentimental drama .
3188	positive	Hugh Grant , who has a good line in charm , has never been more charming than in About a Boy .
89	positive	It shows us a slice of life that 's very different from our own and yet instantly recognizable .
6601	negative	Although purportedly a study in modern alienation , it 's really little more than a particularly slanted , gay s\/m fantasy , enervating and deadeningly drawn-out .
7717	positive	Constantly touching , surprisingly funny , semi-surrealist exploration of the creative act .
1962	neutral	A dreary indulgence .
4435	negative	The Mothman Prophecies , which is mostly a bore , seems to exist only for its climactic setpiece .
6502	positive	Mike White 's deft combination of serious subject matter and dark , funny humor make `` The Good Girl '' a film worth watching .
4230	negative	A cross between Blow and Boyz N The Hood , this movie strives to be more , but does n't quite get there .
7544	positive	Spectacular in every sense of the word , even if you don ' t know an Orc from a Uruk-Hai .
1219	positive	I do n't know if Frailty will turn Bill Paxton into an A-list director , but he can rest contentedly with the knowledge that he 's made at least one damn fine horror movie .

1857	neutral	Those unfamiliar with Mormon traditions may find The Singles Ward occasionally bewildering .
4472	negative	It 's a lot to ask people to sit still for two hours and change watching such a character , especially when rendered in as flat and impassive a manner as Phoenix 's .
4409	negative	Believability was n't one of the film 's virtues .
7137	negative	Wimps out by going for that PG-13 rating , so the more graphic violence is mostly off-screen and the sexuality is muted .
3970	negative	Full of bland hotels , highways , parking lots , with some glimpses of nature and family warmth , Time Out is a discreet moan of despair about entrapment in the maze of modern life .
1834	positive	Poignant and delicately complex .
6522	negative	Little more than a stylish exercise in revisionism whose point ... is no doubt true , but serves as a rather thin moral to such a knowing fable .
4939	negative	There is no psychology here , and no real narrative logic -- just a series of carefully choreographed atrocities , which become strangely impersonal and abstract .
6734	positive	Whenever you think you 've figured out Late Marriage , it throws you for a loop .
1089	positive	Measured against practically any like-themed film other than its Oscar-sweeping franchise predecessor The Silence of the Lambs , Red Dragon rates as an exceptional thriller .

3395	neutral	Feels like nothing quite so much as a middle-aged moviemaker 's attempt to surround himself with beautiful , half-naked women .
6974	positive	A film of epic scale with an intimate feeling , a saga of the ups and downs of friendships .
7294	negative	Instead of using George and Lucy 's most obvious differences to ignite sparks , Lawrence desperately looks elsewhere , seizing on George 's haplessness and Lucy 's personality tics .
1064	negative	With McConaughey in an entirely irony-free zone and Bale reduced mainly to batting his sensitive eyelids , there 's not enough intelligence , wit or innovation on the screen to attract and sustain an older crowd .
5299	neutral	Sometimes this ` Blood ' seems as tired as its protagonist ... Still , the pulse never disappears entirely , and the picture crosses the finish line winded but still game .
4247	positive	No , I love it ... hell , I dunno .
7115	negative	Nothing but one relentlessly depressing situation after another for its entire running time , something that you could easily be dealing with right now in your lives .
7336	neutral	If I have to choose between gorgeous animation and a lame story -LRB- like , say , Treasure Planet -RRB- or so-so animation and an exciting , clever story with a batch of appealing characters , I 'll take the latter every time .

7239	negative	-LRB- Sam 's -RRB- self-flagellation is more depressing than entertaining .
6692	neutral	Simultaneously heartbreakingly beautiful and exquisitely sad .
2078	negative	To me , it sounds like a cruel deception carried out by men of marginal intelligence , with reactionary ideas about women and a total lack of empathy .

1532	neutral	What is the filmmakers ' point ?
8470	positive	Huppert 's show to steal and she makes a meal of it , channeling Kathy Baker 's creepy turn as the repressed mother on Boston Public just as much as 8 Women 's Augustine .
592	positive	If you 're content with a clever pseudo-bio that manages to have a good time as it doles out pieces of the famous director 's life , Eisenstein delivers .
6367	neutral	To work , love stories require the full emotional involvement and support of a viewer .
5199	positive	Amidst the action , the script carries Arnold -LRB- and the viewers -RRB- into the forbidden zone of sympathizing with terrorist motivations by presenting the `` other side of the story . ''
2262	negative	A beautifully shot but dull and ankle-deep ` epic . '
2321	positive	Gaunt , silver-haired and leonine , -LRB- Harris -RRB- brings a tragic dimension and savage full-bodied wit and cunning to the aging Sandeman .
418	positive	I walked away from this new version of E.T. just as I hoped I would -- with moist eyes .

7374	positive	A surprisingly charming and even witty match for the best of Hollywood 's comic-book adaptations .
631	neutral	The film 's darker moments become smoothed over by an overwhelming need to tender inspirational tidings , especially in the last few cloying moments .
6307	positive	A chance to see three splendid actors turn a larky chase movie into an emotionally satisfying exploration of the very human need to be somebody , and to belong to somebody .
4341	negative	A zombie movie in every sense of the word -- mindless , lifeless , meandering , loud , painful , obnoxious .
3217	neutral	Except for Paymer as the boss who ultimately expresses empathy for Bartleby 's pain , the performances are so stylized as to be drained of human emotion .
1118	negative	Anemic , pretentious .
8255	neutral	Some movies can get by without being funny simply by structuring the scenes as if they were jokes : a setup , delivery and payoff .
2769	negative	At times , it actually hurts to watch .
6051	neutral	Chomp chomp !
4703	positive	Beautiful , angry and sad , with a curious sick poetry , as if the Marquis de Sade had gone in for pastel landscapes .
2948	negative	A movie more to be prescribed than recommended -- as visually bland as a dentist 's waiting room , complete with soothing Muzak and a cushion of predictable narrative rhythms .
136	positive	One of the year 's most weirdly engaging and unpredictable character pieces .
7436	negative	A lame comedy .
717	positive	Poetry in motion captured on film .
478	neutral	Jonah is only so-so ... the addition of a biblical message will either improve the film for you , or it will lessen it .
8237	positive	An oddity , to be sure , but one that you might wind up remembering with a degree of affection rather than revulsion .
5442	positive	Left me with the visceral sensation of longing , lasting traces of Charlotte 's web of desire and desperation .
6710	negative	Insomnia loses points when it surrenders to a formulaic bang-bang , shoot-em-up scene at the conclusion .
6726	negative	It would be churlish to begrudge anyone for receiving whatever consolation that can be found in Dragonfly , yet it is impossible to find the film anything but appalling , shamelessly manipulative and contrived , and totally lacking in conviction .
4923	negative	As it stands , Crocodile Hunter has the hurried , badly cobbled look of the 1959 Godzilla , which combined scenes of a Japanese monster flick with canned shots of Raymond Burr commenting on the monster 's path of destruction .
3956	negative	Staggers between flaccid satire and what is supposed to be madcap farce .
4817	negative	The movie wavers between Hallmark card sentimentality and goofy , life-affirming moments straight out of a cellular phone commercial .
7713	positive	A very good film sits in the place where a masterpiece should be .
2338	positive	Beresford nicely mixes in as much humor as pathos to take us on his sentimental journey of the heart .
3364	positive	As banal as the telling may be -- and at times , All My Loved Ones more than flirts with kitsch -- the tale commands attention .
2873	positive	Pure cinematic intoxication , a wildly inventive mixture of comedy and melodrama , tastelessness and swooning elegance .
5278	positive	Unlike lots of Hollywood fluff , this has layered , well-developed characters and some surprises .
6234	positive	It is life affirming and heartbreaking , sweet without the decay factor , funny and sad .
6306	positive	Passions , obsessions , and loneliest dark spots are pushed to their most virtuous limits , lending the narrative an unusually surreal tone .
3919	negative	... contains very few laughs and even less surprises .
4142	negative	Every so often a film comes along that is so insanely stupid , so awful in so many ways that watching it leaves you giddy .
6065	neutral	While certain cues , like the happy music , suggest that this movie is supposed to warm our hearts , Jeong-Hyang Lee 's film is just as likely to blacken that organ with cold vengefulness .
432	neutral	Paul Bettany playing Malcolm McDowell ?
8446	positive	... by the time it 's done with us , Mira Nair 's new movie has its audience giddy with the delight of discovery , of having been immersed in a foreign culture only to find that human nature is pretty much the same all over .
1607	negative	The movie is concocted and carried out by folks worthy of scorn , and the nicest thing I can say is that I ca n't remember a single name responsible for it .
6266	negative	It 's unfortunate that Wallace , who wrote Gibson 's Braveheart as well as the recent Pearl Harbor , has such an irrepressible passion for sappy situations and dialogue .
7415	negative	This is an action movie with an action icon who 's been all but decommissioned .
4787	neutral	Defies logic , the laws of physics and almost anyone 's willingness to believe in it .
6936	positive	I 'm guessing the director is a magician .
2154	positive	Daily struggles and simple pleasures usurp the preaching message so that , by the time the credits roll across the pat ending , a warm , fuzzy feeling prevails .

1572	negative	... Liotta is put in an impossible spot because his character 's deceptions ultimately undo him and the believability of the entire scenario .
4263	positive	A much more successful translation than its most famous previous film adaptation , writer-director Anthony Friedman 's similarly updated 1970 British production .
3204	positive	Trapped wo n't score points for political correctness , but it may cause parents a few sleepless hours -- a sign of its effectiveness .
8468	positive	This is a more fascinating look at the future than `` Bladerunner '' and one of the most high-concept sci fi adventures attempted for the screen .
4585	negative	Filled with low-brow humor , gratuitous violence and a disturbing disregard for life .
3732	negative	Although it tries to be much more , it 's really just another Major League .
8285	positive	-LRB- The Cockettes -RRB- provides a window into a subculture hell-bent on expressing itself in every way imaginable . '
7631	negative	All the characters are clinically depressed and have abandoned their slim hopes and dreams .
4344	positive	Straightforward and old-fashioned in the best possible senses of both those words , Possession is a movie that puts itself squarely in the service of the lovers who inhabit it .
1230	negative	The movie spends more time with Schneider than with newcomer McAdams , even though her performance is more interesting -LRB- and funnier -RRB- than his .
5333	negative	If nothing else , `` Rollerball '' 2002 may go down in cinema history as the only movie ever in which the rest of the cast was outshined by LL Cool J.
543	positive	What sets this romantic comedy apart from most Hollywood romantic comedies is its low-key way of tackling what seems like done-to-death material .
2483	negative	Fails to convince the audience that these brats will ever be anything more than losers .
7792	negative	One long , numbing action sequence made up mostly of routine stuff Yuen has given us before .
3806	positive	Fulford-Wierzbicki ... deftly captures the wise-beyond-her-years teen .
6906	negative	Eventually , they will have a showdown , but , by then , your senses are as mushy as peas and you do n't care who fires the winning shot .
2839	negative	The three leads produce adequate performances , but what 's missing from this material is any depth of feeling .
1926	neutral	It 's not hateful .
2749	neutral	What with the incessant lounge music playing in the film 's background , you may mistake Love Liza for an Adam Sandler Chanukah song .
1204	neutral	Watching E.T now , in an era dominated by cold , loud special-effects-laden extravaganzas , one is struck less by its lavish grandeur than by its intimacy and precision .
7173	neutral	Elmo touts his drug as being 51 times stronger than coke .
3578	positive	Leigh succeeds in delivering a dramatic slap in the face that 's simultaneously painful and refreshing .
4584	neutral	It 's better than mid-range Steven Seagal , but not as sharp as Jet Li on rollerblades .
2825	negative	This is a film living far too much in its own head .
3219	negative	The film is an earnest try at beachcombing verismo , but it would be even more indistinct than it is were it not for the striking , quietly vulnerable personality of Ms. Ambrose .
7782	negative	Imagine O. Henry 's The Gift of the Magi relocated to the scuzzy underbelly of NYC 's drug scene .
2980	negative	You do n't know whether to admire the film 's stately nature and call it classicism or be exasperated by a noticeable lack of pace .
6605	negative	An opportunity missed .
3458	negative	A rehash of every gangster movie from the past decade .
5515	negative	The picture emerges as a surprisingly anemic disappointment .
980	positive	Its compelling mix of trial movie , escape movie and unexpected fable ensures the film never feels draggy .

398	negative	This misty-eyed Southern nostalgia piece , in treading the line between sappy and sanguine , winds up mired in tear-drenched quicksand .

7556	negative	You ... get a sense of good intentions derailed by a failure to seek and strike just the right tone .
1220	negative	This movie , a certain scene in particular , brought me uncomfortably close to losing my lunch .
1295	positive	In an ART FILM !
651	positive	Evokes the 19th century with a subtlety that is an object lesson in period filmmaking .
8242	negative	After a while , Hoffman 's quirks and mannerisms , particularly his penchant for tearing up on cue -- things that seem so real in small doses -- become annoying and artificial .
4047	negative	A sustained fest of self-congratulation between actor and director that leaves scant place for the viewer .
6489	neutral	Tony Gayton 's script does n't give us anything we have n't seen before , but director D.J. Caruso 's grimy visual veneer and Kilmer 's absorbing performance increase the gravitational pull considerably .
6677	negative	The Piano Teacher , like its title character , is repellantly out of control .
4938	positive	Insanely hilarious !
6909	negative	The film is so busy making reference to other films and trying to be other films that it fails to have a heart , mind or humor of its own .
5649	positive	It may not be a great piece of filmmaking , but its power comes from its soul 's - eye view of how well-meaning patronizing masked a social injustice , at least as represented by this case .
6243	negative	There is no solace here , no entertainment value , merely a fierce lesson in where filmmaking can take us .
7008	negative	It 's better suited for the history or biography channel , but there 's no arguing the tone of the movie - it leaves a bad taste in your mouth and questions on your mind .
8144	neutral	How I Killed My Father would be a rarity in Hollywood .
7826	negative	If you want a movie time trip , the 1960 version is a far smoother ride .
7612	negative	The original was n't a good movie but this remake makes it look like a masterpiece !
5369	positive	Audiences are advised to sit near the back and squint to avoid noticing some truly egregious lip-non-synching , but otherwise the production is suitably elegant .
1733	neutral	the shackles
3249	positive	Predictable and cloying , though Brown Sugar is so earnest in its yearning for the days before rap went nihilistic that it summons more spirit and bite than your average formulaic romantic quadrangle .
2654	negative	Stealing Harvard does n't care about cleverness , wit or any other kind of intelligent humor .
559	positive	The Wild Thornberrys Movie has all the sibling rivalry and general family chaos to which anyone can relate .
747	negative	Low comedy does n't come much lower .
2428	positive	The beautifully choreographed kitchen ballet is simple but absorbing .
3750	positive	... a great , participatory spectator sport . '
8046	neutral	The film thrusts the inchoate but already eldritch Christian Right propaganda machine into national media circles .
6789	positive	It 's affecting , amusing , sad and reflective .
2135	negative	With more character development this might have been an eerie thriller ; with better payoffs , it could have been a thinking man 's monster movie .
6920	positive	Whatever complaints I might have , I 'd take -LRB- its -RRB- earnest errors and hard-won rewards over the bombastic self-glorification of other feel-good fiascos like Antwone Fisher or The Emperor 's Club any time .
7899	positive	The film becomes an overwhelming pleasure , and you find yourself rooting for Gai 's character to avoid the fate that has befallen every other Carmen before her .
3107	positive	Though its story is only surface deep , the visuals and enveloping sounds of Blue Crush make this surprisingly decent flick worth a summertime look-see .
6382	negative	... a hokey piece of nonsense that tries too hard to be emotional .
8423	positive	Zoom !
7758	neutral	A penetrating glimpse into the tissue-thin ego of the stand-up comic .
7796	negative	It might not be 1970s animation , but everything else about it is straight from the Saturday morning cartoons -- a retread story , bad writing , and the same old silliness .
5799	positive	About the best thing you could say about Narc is that it 's a rock-solid little genre picture .
4681	positive	High drama , Disney-style - a wing and a prayer and a hunky has-been pursuing his castle in the sky .
2972	positive	Tsai has a well-deserved reputation as one of the cinema world 's great visual stylists , and in this film , every shot enhances the excellent performances .
6732	negative	Depicts the sorriest and most sordid of human behavior on the screen , then laughs at how clever it 's being .
1207	neutral	Absurdities and
243	positive	At a time when commercialism has squeezed the life out of whatever idealism American moviemaking ever had , Godfrey Reggio 's career shines like a lonely beacon .
6339	neutral	It 's all entertaining enough , but do n't look for any hefty anti-establishment message in what is essentially a whip-crack of a buddy movie that ends with a whimper .
1846	neutral	You get the idea , though , that Kapur intended the film to be more than that .
3579	positive	At just over an hour , Home Movie will leave you wanting more , not to mention leaving you with some laughs and a smile on your face .
3842	negative	The premise of `` Abandon '' holds promise , ... but its delivery is a complete mess .
7222	positive	Give credit to everyone from Robinson down to the key grip that this bold move works .
4563	positive	There are n't too many films that can be as simultaneously funny , offbeat and heartwarming -LRB- without a thick shmear of the goo , at least -RRB- , but `` Elling '' manages to do all three quite well , making it one of the year 's most enjoyable releases .
3808	negative	The film is way too full of itself ; it 's stuffy and pretentious in a give-me-an-Oscar kind of way .
5193	positive	The observations of this social\/economic\/urban environment are canny and spiced with irony .
6235	neutral	The film is explosive , but a few of those sticks are wet .
4328	negative	... Pray does n't have a passion for the material .
2589	positive	The animated sequences are well done and perfectly constructed to convey a sense of childhood imagination and creating adventure out of angst .
7569	positive	It is refreshingly undogmatic about its characters .
312	negative	... irritating soul-searching garbage .
4206	positive	Director Peter Kosminsky gives these women a forum to demonstrate their acting ` chops ' and they take full advantage .
2473	negative	Never having seen the first two films in the series , I ca n't compare Friday After Next to them , but nothing would change the fact that what we have here is a load of clams left in the broiling sun for a good three days .
83	neutral	The Pianist lacks the quick emotional connections of Steven Spielberg 's Schindler 's List .
6273	negative	Earnest yet curiously tepid and choppy recycling in which predictability is the only winner .
3194	neutral	While Hoffman 's performance is great , the subject matter goes nowhere .
1677	neutral	At its worst , the movie is pretty diverting ; the pity is that it rarely achieves its best .
2076	neutral	Although Barbershop boasts some of today 's hottest and hippest acts from the world of television , music and stand-up comedy , this movie strangely enough has the outdated swagger of a shameless ` 70s blaxploitation shuck-and-jive sitcom .
6579	positive	A weird , arresting little ride .
395	positive	Maybe it is formula filmmaking , but there 's nothing wrong with that if the film is well-crafted and this one is .
4801	positive	Two Weeks Notice has appeal beyond being a Sandra Bullock vehicle or a standard romantic comedy .
5956	negative	Barely manages for but a few seconds over its seemingly eternal running time to pique your interest , your imagination , your empathy or anything , really , save your disgust and your indifference .
5794	negative	Unfortunately , we 'd prefer a simple misfire .
7968	neutral	Still , not every low-budget movie must be quirky or bleak , and a happy ending is no cinematic sin .
3777	positive	I 'm sure mainstream audiences will be baffled , but , for those with at least a minimal appreciation of Woolf and Clarissa Dalloway , The Hours represents two of those well spent .
637	positive	As an actress , Madonna is one helluva singer .
4	positive	A positively thrilling combination of ethnography and all the intrigue , betrayal , deceit and murder of a Shakespearean tragedy or a juicy soap opera .
6841	positive	It manages to squeeze by on Angelina Jolie 's surprising flair for self-deprecating comedy .
2762	neutral	It 's sweet ... but just a little bit too precious at the start and a little too familiar at the end .
2116	positive	Those eternally devoted to the insanity of Black will have an intermittently good time .
7109	positive	Though this saga would be terrific to read about , it is dicey screen material that only a genius should touch .
4384	positive	It 's a setup so easy it borders on facile , but keeping the film from cheap-shot mediocrity is its crack cast .
3977	neutral	Not everyone will play the dark , challenging tune taught by The Piano Teacher .
1840	positive	With exquisite craftsmanship ... Olivier Assayas has fashioned an absorbing look at provincial bourgeois French society .
7040	positive	There are enough throwaway references to faith and rainbows to plant smile-button faces on that segment of the populace that made A Walk to Remember a niche hit .
7744	negative	It 's as if De Palma spent an hour setting a fancy table and then served up Kraft Macaroni and Cheese .
5788	positive	MY LITTLE EYE is the best little `` horror '' movie I 've seen in years .
2875	negative	Everything was as superficial as the forced New Jersey lowbrow accent Uma had .
3443	positive	The film occasionally tries the viewer 's patience with slow pacing and a main character who sometimes defies sympathy , but it ultimately satisfies with its moving story .
8080	negative	The first hour is tedious though Ford and Neeson capably hold our interest , but its just not a thrilling movie .
4698	positive	The soundtrack alone is worth the price of admission .
2046	neutral	... hopefully it 'll be at the dollar theatres by the time Christmas rolls around .
1933	positive	The Bourne Identity should n't be half as entertaining as it is , but director Doug Liman and his colleagues have managed to pack it with enough action to satisfy the boom-bam crowd without a huge sacrifice of character and mood .
321	positive	So original in its base concept that you can not help but get caught up .
3118	negative	The script ?
6895	negative	Suffers from unlikable characters and a self-conscious sense of its own quirky hipness .
60	positive	Transforms one of -LRB- Shakespeare 's -RRB- deepest tragedies into a smart new comedy .
6173	positive	Who knows , but it works under the direction of Kevin Reynolds .
7940	positive	How good this film might be , depends if you believe that the shocking conclusion is too much of a plunge or not .
4691	positive	I 've yet to find an actual Vietnam War combat movie actually produced by either the North or South Vietnamese , but at least now we 've got something pretty damn close .
1264	negative	The movie is as padded as Allen 's jelly belly .
5030	positive	Fast-paced and wonderfully edited , the film is extremely thorough .
5810	positive	Miyazaki has created such a vibrant , colorful world , it 's almost impossible not to be swept away by the sheer beauty of his images .
7148	positive	Talk To Her is not the perfect movie many have made it out to be , but it 's still quite worth seeing .
3832	negative	Would that Greengrass had gone a tad less for grit and a lot more for intelligibility .
1904	neutral	The only upside to all of this unpleasantness is , given its Labor Day weekend upload , FearDotCom should log a minimal number of hits .
4389	negative	A grand fart coming from a director beginning to resemble someone 's crazy French grandfather .
1197	positive	If you have n't seen the film lately , you may be surprised at the variety of tones in Spielberg 's work .
3855	positive	Top-notch action powers this romantic drama .
4571	neutral	Nor is it a romantic comedy .
589	positive	Hashiguchi uses the situation to evoke a Japan bustling atop an undercurrent of loneliness and isolation .
309	positive	Seeing as the film lacks momentum and its position remains mostly undeterminable , the director 's experiment is a successful one .
4029	positive	Like Brosnan 's performance , Evelyn comes from the heart .
3119	negative	No cliche escapes the perfervid treatment of gang warfare called ces Wild .
2225	negative	The Tuxedo was n't just bad ; it was , as my friend David Cross would call it , ` Hungry-Man portions of bad ' .
4975	positive	The film is a hoot , and is just as good , if not better than much of what 's on Saturday morning TV especially the pseudo-educational stuff we all ca n't stand .
1315	neutral	National Lampoon 's Van Wilder may aim to be the next Animal House , but it more closely resembles this year 's version of Tomcats .
220	negative	A film that plays things so nice 'n safe as to often play like a milquetoast movie of the week blown up for the big screen .
254	negative	Some of the computer animation is handsome , and various amusing sidekicks add much-needed levity to the otherwise bleak tale , but overall the film never rises above mediocrity .
2596	positive	It 's anchored by splendid performances from an honored screen veteran and a sparkling newcomer who instantly transform themselves into a believable mother\/daughter pair .
4288	negative	Shreve 's graceful dual narrative gets clunky on the screen , and we keep getting torn away from the compelling historical tale to a less-compelling soap opera .
311	negative	Uneven performances and a spotty script add up to a biting satire that has no teeth .
7763	neutral	We get light showers of emotion a couple of times , but then -- strangely -- these wane to an inconsistent and ultimately unsatisfying drizzle .
6992	negative	It forces you to watch people doing unpleasant things to each other and themselves , and it maintains a cool distance from its material that is deliberately unsettling .
6204	positive	It 's a masterpiece .
8051	positive	Nair does n't treat the issues lightly .
1097	positive	The sheer joy and pride they took in their work -- and in each other -- shines through every frame .
2788	negative	Curiously , Super Troopers suffers because it does n't have enough vices to merit its 103-minute length .
4488	negative	-LRB- A -RRB- crushing disappointment .
4664	negative	The premise itself is just SOOOOO tired .
6009	neutral	I have two words to say about Reign of Fire .
5358	negative	Instead of a balanced film that explains the zeitgeist that is the X Games , we get a cinematic postcard that 's superficial and unrealized .
5970	positive	K-19 : The Widowmaker is derivative , overlong , and bombastic -- yet surprisingly entertaining .
7396	negative	There are some laughs in this movie , but Williams ' anarchy gets tiresome , the satire is weak .
1382	negative	It concentrates far too much on the awkward interplay and utter lack of chemistry between Chan and Hewitt .
4908	negative	Mr. Deeds is not really a film as much as it is a loose collection of not-so-funny gags , scattered moments of lazy humor .
4431	negative	Has all the scenic appeal of a cesspool .
5554	negative	A movie in which two not very absorbing characters are engaged in a romance you ca n't wait to see end .
8420	positive	Alarms for Duvall 's throbbing sincerity and his elderly propensity for patting people while he talks .
8350	negative	Purposefully shocking in its eroticized gore , if unintentionally dull in its lack of poetic frissons .
2097	positive	Visually striking and viscerally repellent .
1808	neutral	At its best ... Festival in Cannes bubbles with the excitement of the festival in Cannes .
3297	positive	Pacino is the best he 's been in years and Keener is marvelous .

5092	neutral	It is not what you see , it is what you think you see .
1054	neutral	-LRB- Crystal and De Niro -RRB- manage to squeeze out some good laughs but not enough to make this silly con job sing .
451	neutral	Ca n't seem to get anywhere near the story 's center .
1777	negative	Brainless , but enjoyably over-the-top , the retro gang melodrama , Deuces Wild represents fifties teen-gang machismo in a way that borders on rough-trade homo-eroticism .
4312	positive	A sweet-tempered comedy that forgoes the knee-jerk misogyny that passes for humor in so many teenage comedies .
1392	positive	A film that 's flawed and brilliant in equal measure .
3828	positive	Tadpole may be one of the most appealing movies ever made about an otherwise appalling , and downright creepy , subject -- a teenage boy in love with his stepmother .
4324	negative	The obnoxious special effects , the obligatory outbursts of flatulence and the incessant , so-five-minutes-ago pop music on the soundtrack overwhelm what is left of the scruffy , dopey old Hanna-Barbera charm .
7033	negative	Feels like the work of someone who may indeed have finally aged past his prime ... and , perhaps more than he realizes , just wants to be liked by the people who can still give him work .
4864	positive	A tour de force drama about the astonishingly pivotal role of imagination in the soulful development of two rowdy teenagers .
1513	positive	Deep intelligence and a warm , enveloping affection breathe out of every frame .
2635	positive	An unexpectedly sweet story of sisterhood .
4557	negative	Does n't add up to much .
6276	positive	A completely spooky piece of business that gets under your skin and , some plot blips aside , stays there for the duration .
6549	negative	Only masochistic moviegoers need apply .
1651	positive	The film has a laundry list of minor shortcomings , but the numerous scenes of gory mayhem are worth the price of admission ... if `` gory mayhem '' is your idea of a good time .
4915	positive	There is a general air of exuberance in All About The Benjamins that 's hard to resist .
3304	positive	Oh , and more entertaining , too .
904	negative	Every sequel you skip will be two hours gained .
3609	negative	Silly stuff , all mixed up together like a term paper from a kid who ca n't quite distinguish one sci-fi work from another .
3696	neutral	The filmmakers lack the nerve ... to fully exploit the script 's potential for sick humor .
4330	negative	The hackneyed story about an affluent damsel in distress who decides to fight her bully of a husband is simply too overdone .
493	positive	Captures the raw comic energy of one of our most flamboyant female comics .
1802	negative	An authentically vague , but ultimately purposeless , study in total pandemonium .
6430	negative	Instead of contriving a climactic hero 's death for the beloved-major - character-who-shall - remain-nameless , why not invite some genuine spontaneity into the film by having the evil aliens ' laser guns actually hit something for once ?
3028	positive	What -LRB- Denis -RRB- accomplishes in his chilling , unnerving film is a double portrait of two young women whose lives were as claustrophic , suffocating and chilly as the attics to which they were inevitably consigned .
634	positive	Triple X is a double agent , and he 's one bad dude .
4188	positive	Exciting and well-paced .
6908	neutral	13 Conversations may be a bit too enigmatic and overly ambitious to be fully successful , but Sprecher and her screenwriting partner and sister , Karen Sprecher , do n't seem ever to run out of ideas .

3469	positive	A mature , deeply felt fantasy of a director 's travel through 300 years of Russian history .
3766	negative	It desperately wants to be a wacky , screwball comedy , but the most screwy thing here is how so many talented people were convinced to waste their time .
966	positive	Real Women Have Curves wears its empowerment on its sleeve but even its worst harangues are easy to swallow thanks to remarkable performances by Ferrera and Ontiveros .
5871	positive	A deftly entertaining film , smartly played and smartly directed .

1563	positive	And thanks to Kline 's superbly nuanced performance , that pondering is highly pleasurable .
3825	positive	A fresh , entertaining comedy that looks at relationships minus traditional gender roles .
6686	negative	Horrible .
4736	positive	Holm does his sly , intricate magic , and Iben Hjelje is entirely appealing as Pumpkin .
3368	positive	I 've never seen or heard anything quite like this film , and I recommend it for its originality alone .

6069	negative	No laughs .
6812	negative	Very much a home video , and so devoid of artifice and purpose that it appears not to have been edited at all .
2171	neutral	As Allen 's execution date closes in , the documentary gives an especially poignant portrait of her friendship with the never flagging legal investigator David Presson .
6071	neutral	The story is so light and sugary that were it a Macy 's Thanksgiving Day Parade balloon , extra heavy-duty ropes would be needed to keep it from floating away .
2198	positive	One of the very best movies ever made about the life of moviemaking .
3574	negative	It 's super - violent , super-serious and super-stupid .

4199	positive	Like the best 60 Minutes
1851	neutral	The film has too many spots where it 's on slippery footing , but is acceptable entertainment for the entire family and one that 's especially fit for the kiddies .
6220	negative	` Butterfingered ' is the word for the big-fisted direction of Jez Butterworth , who manages to blast even the smallest sensitivities from the romance with his clamorous approach .
4233	positive	Effective in all its aspects , Margarita Happy Hour represents an auspicious feature debut for Chaiken .
6144	neutral	Gangs , despite the gravity of its subject matter , is often as fun to watch as a good spaghetti western .

817	negative	If you are curious to see the darker side of what 's going on with young TV actors -LRB- Dawson Leery did what ?!? -RRB- , or see some interesting storytelling devices , you might want to check it out , but there 's nothing very attractive about this movie .

5370	neutral	This rough trade Punch-and-Judy act did n't play well then and it plays worse now .
3944	negative	Dreary tale of middle-class angst
3493	positive	It 's usually a bad sign when directors abandon their scripts and go where the moment takes them , but Olympia , Wash. , based filmmakers Anne de Marcken and Marilyn Freeman did just that and it 's what makes their project so interesting .
5497	negative	... comes alive only when it switches gears to the sentimental .
2787	negative	What little atmosphere is generated by the shadowy lighting , macabre sets , and endless rain is offset by the sheer ugliness of everything else .
1243	negative	Boasts eye-catching art direction but has a forcefully quirky tone that quickly wears out its limited welcome .
1784	positive	As an introduction to the man 's theories and influence , Derrida is all but useless ; as a portrait of the artist as an endlessly inquisitive old man , however , it 's invaluable .
707	neutral	Ultimate X is a ride , basically the kind of greatest-hits reel that might come with a subscription to ESPN the Magazine .
540	negative	Dignified CEO 's meet at a rustic retreat and pee against a tree .
7675	negative	... Stylistically , the movie is a disaster .

3623	positive	An entertaining documentary that freshly considers arguments the Bard 's immortal plays were written by somebody else .
4108	neutral	Explosions , jokes , and sexual innuendoes abound .
3866	negative	Build some robots , haul 'em to the theatre with you for the late show , and put on your own Mystery Science Theatre 3000 tribute to what is almost certainly going to go down as the worst -- and only -- killer website movie of this or any other year .

6503	positive	The film 's unhurried pace is actually one of its strengths .
245	positive	Robert Harmon 's less-is-more approach delivers real bump-in - the-night chills -- his greatest triumph is keeping the creepy crawlies hidden in the film 's thick shadows .
6754	negative	Rosenthal -LRB- Halloween II -RRB- seems to have forgotten everything he ever knew about generating suspense .
5884	positive	Simply put , `` Far From Heaven '' is a masterpiece .
8283	neutral	The messy emotions raging throughout this three-hour effort are instantly recognizable , allowing the film to paradoxically feel familiar and foreign at the same time .
4123	neutral	Reyes ' word processor .
8008	negative	There 's a little violence and lots of sex in a bid to hold our attention , but it grows monotonous after a while , as do Joan and Philip 's repetitive arguments , schemes and treachery .
8246	negative	Exploitative and largely devoid of the depth or sophistication that would make watching such a graphic treatment of the crimes bearable .
6921	negative	It 's not so much a movie as a joint promotion for the National Basketball Association and teenaged rap and adolescent poster-boy Lil ' Bow Wow .
8375	negative	This angst-ridden territory was covered earlier and much better in Ordinary People .
3998	negative	It takes a really long , slow and dreary time to dope out what TUCK EVERLASTING is about .
1276	negative	All the more disquieting for its relatively gore-free allusions to the serial murders , but it falls down in its attempts to humanize its subject .
2166	negative	Eisenstein lacks considerable brio for a film about one of cinema 's directorial giants .

4354	positive	Rouge is less about a superficial midlife crisis than it is about the need to stay in touch with your own skin , at 18 or 80 .
2977	negative	Lacking substance and soul , Crossroads comes up shorter than Britney 's cutoffs .
2309	negative	The project 's filmmakers forgot to include anything even halfway scary as they poorly rejigger Fatal Attraction into a high school setting .

8125	positive	An elegant and sly deadpan comedy .
5700	negative	It is messy , uncouth , incomprehensible , vicious and absurd .
8057	neutral	Though excessively tiresome , The Uncertainty Principle , as verbally pretentious as the title may be , has its handful of redeeming features , as long as you discount its ability to bore .
119	positive	The filmmakers want nothing else than to show us a good time , and in their cheap , B movie way , they succeed .

6088	negative	The truth about Charlie is that it 's a brazenly misguided project .
1746	positive	A taut , sobering film .
1368	negative	This is the kind of movie that you only need to watch for about thirty seconds before you say to yourself , ` Ah , yes , here we have a bad , bad , bad movie . '
2814	negative	Simply a re-hash of the other seven films .
7926	positive	It 's absolutely amazing how first-time director Kevin Donovan managed to find something new to add to the canon of Chan .
7315	negative	It 's a thin notion , repetitively stretched out to feature length , awash in self-consciously flashy camera effects , droning house music and flat , flat dialogue .
171	negative	Nothing more than an amiable but unfocused bagatelle that plays like a loosely-connected string of acting-workshop exercises .

1767	negative	There are some fairly unsettling scenes , but they never succeed in really rattling the viewer .

7194	positive	A must see for all sides of the political spectrum
234	negative	Ah , yes , that would be me : fighting off the urge to doze .
2989	negative	... post-September 11 , `` The Sum Of All Fears '' seems more tacky and reprehensible , manipulating our collective fear without bestowing the subject with the intelligence or sincerity it unequivocally deserves .
906	neutral	They exist for hushed lines like `` They 're back ! ''
7962	negative	Despite its sincere acting , Signs is just another unoriginal run of the mill sci-fi film with a flimsy ending and lots of hype .
1560	negative	So bland and utterly forgettable that it might as well have been titled Generic Jennifer Lopez Romantic Comedy .
3043	negative	But one thing 's for sure : It never comes close to being either funny or scary .
7031	negative	-LRB- Jackson and Bledel -RRB- seem to have been picked not for their acting chops , but for their looks and appeal to the pre-teen crowd .
6787	neutral	If legendary shlockmeister Ed Wood had ever made a movie about a vampire , it probably would look a lot like this alarming production , adapted from Anne Rice 's novel The Vampire Chronicles .
7674	positive	A movie that will surely be profane , politically charged music to the ears of Cho 's fans .
5089	positive	The cast , collectively a successful example of the lovable-loser protagonist , shows deft comic timing .
7172	positive	I loved the look of this film .
3152	positive	As comedic spotlights go , Notorious C.H.O. hits all the verbal marks it should .
792	negative	With `` Ichi the Killer '' , Takashi Miike , Japan 's wildest filmmaker gives us a crime fighter carrying more emotional baggage than Batman ...
1195	positive	-LRB- A -RRB- satisfying niblet .
5401	negative	The only problem is that , by the end , no one in the audience or the film seems to really care .
4180	positive	The level of acting elevates the material above pat inspirational status and gives it a sturdiness and solidity that we 've long associated with Washington the actor .
8317	neutral	... best seen as speculative history , as much an exploration of the paranoid impulse as a creative sequel to the Warren Report .
2397	neutral	Dolman confines himself to shtick and sentimentality -- the one bald and the other sloppy .
509	positive	I stopped thinking about how good it all was , and started doing nothing but reacting to it - feeling a part of its grand locations , thinking urgently as the protagonists struggled , feeling at the mercy of its inventiveness , gasping at its visual delights .
5535	negative	Pretend it 's a werewolf itself by avoiding eye contact and walking slowly away .
4395	positive	has a whip-smart sense of narrative bluffs .
4204	positive	Broomfield reminds us that beneath the hype , the celebrity , the high life , the conspiracies and the mystery there were once a couple of bright young men -- promising , talented , charismatic and tragically doomed .
7350	neutral	Often overwrought and at times positively irritating , the film turns into an engrossing thriller almost in spite of itself .
2800	positive	Sheds light on a subject few are familiar with , and makes you care about music you may not have heard before .
3792	negative	Decent but dull .
6715	positive	A fantastically vital movie that manages to invest real humor , sensuality , and sympathy into a story about two adolescent boys .
4087	negative	I ca n't recommend it .
8060	positive	Me Without You has a bracing truth that 's refreshing after the phoniness of female-bonding pictures like Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood .
2693	neutral	The movie is essentially a series of fleetingly interesting actors ' moments .
1842	neutral	The central character is n't complex enough to hold our interest .
3699	negative	It makes me say the obvious : Abandon all hope of a good movie ye who enter here .
2600	neutral	The good is very , very good ... The rest runs from mildly unimpressive to despairingly awful .
1188	positive	The large-format film is well suited to capture these musicians in full regalia and the incredible IMAX sound system lets you feel the beat down to your toes .
6048	positive	Vibrantly colored and beautifully designed , Metropolis is a feast for the eyes .
8275	negative	I 've seen some bad singer-turned actors , but Lil Bow Wow takes the cake .
5533	neutral	Kenneth Branagh 's energetic sweet-and-sour performance as a curmudgeonly British playwright grounds this overstuffed , erratic dramedy in which he and his improbably forbearing wife contend with craziness and child-rearing in Los Angeles .
8244	negative	Who cares ? -RRB- .
102	positive	A surprisingly ` solid ' achievement by director Malcolm D. Lee and writer John Ridley .
4248	positive	It 's an exhilarating place to visit , this laboratory of laughter .
5106	positive	A little melodramatic , but with enough hope to keep you engaged .
6572	neutral	Your response to its new sequel , Analyze That , may hinge on what you thought of the first film .
868	positive	The IMAX screen enhances the personal touch of manual animation .
3834	positive	-LRB- Reno -RRB- delivers a monologue that manages to incorporate both the horror and the absurdity of the situation in a well-balanced fashion .
1970	positive	The search for redemption makes for a touching love story , mainly because Blanchett and Ribisi compellingly tap into a spiritual aspect of their characters ' suffering .
62	positive	But arriving at a particularly dark moment in history , it offers flickering reminders of the ties that bind us .
4754	negative	The story suffers a severe case of oversimplification , superficiality and silliness .
7678	negative	Given too much time to consider the looseness of the piece , the picture begins to resemble the shapeless , grasping actors ' workshop that it is .
729	negative	It 's definitely not made for kids or their parents , for that matter , and I think even fans of Sandler 's comic taste may find it uninteresting .
3192	positive	Skins has a desolate air , but Eyre , a Native American raised by white parents , manages to infuse the rocky path to sibling reconciliation with flashes of warmth and gentle humor .
2881	negative	Directed without the expected flair or imagination by Hong Kong master John Woo , Windtalkers airs just about every cliche in the war movie compendium across its indulgent two-hour-and-fifteen-minute length .
1705	positive	He drags it back , single-handed .
6598	negative	A fairly harmless but ultimately lifeless feature-length afterschool special .
4157	negative	an appalling ` Ace Ventura ' rip-off that somehow manages to bring together Kevin Pollak , former wrestler Chyna and Dolly Parton .
280	negative	In addition to the overcooked , ham-fisted direction , which has all the actors reaching for the back row , the dialogue sounds like horrible poetry .
591	neutral	The next big thing 's not-so-big -LRB- and not-so-hot -RRB- directorial debut .
7142	positive	Extremely well acted by the four primary actors , this is a seriously intended movie that is not easily forgotten .
6535	negative	The filmmakers keep pushing the jokes at the expense of character until things fall apart .
1974	positive	It 's nice to see Piscopo again after all these years , and Chaykin and Headly are priceless .
3752	negative	Ararat feels like a book report
1562	negative	It lacks the compassion , good-natured humor and the level of insight that made -LRB- Eyre 's -RRB- first film something of a sleeper success .
6294	positive	A heroic tale of persistence that is sure to win viewers ' hearts .
9	negative	But it does n't leave you with much .
2552	positive	`` Birthday Girl '' is an actor 's movie first and foremost .
7522	neutral	Mostly Martha could have used a little trimming -- 10 or 15 minutes could be cut and no one would notice -- but it 's a pleasurable trifle .
2319	positive	Methodical , measured , and gently tedious in its comedy , Secret Ballot is a purposefully reductive movie -- which may be why it 's so successful at lodging itself in the brain .
5796	neutral	Although tender and touching , the movie would have benefited from a little more dramatic tension and some more editing .
304	positive	What begins as a conventional thriller evolves into a gorgeously atmospheric meditation on life-changing chance encounters .
1640	positive	Like its title character , this Nicholas Nickleby finds itself in reduced circumstances -- and , also like its hero , it remains brightly optimistic , coming through in the end .
4287	neutral	But here 's a glimpse at his life .
532	positive	This is one of Mr. Chabrol 's subtlest works , but also one of his most uncanny .
8518	positive	Has a certain ghoulish fascination , and generates a fair amount of B-movie excitement .
7229	negative	The narrator and the other characters try to convince us that acting transfigures Esther , but she 's never seen speaking on stage ; one feels cheated , and Esther seems to remain an unchanged dullard .
3135	positive	Gooding is the energetic frontman , and it 's hard to resist his enthusiasm , even if the filmmakers come up with nothing original in the way of slapstick sequences .
722	positive	Ms. Hutchins is talented enough and charismatic enough to make us care about Zelda 's ultimate fate .
6059	negative	The Irwins ' scenes are fascinating ; the movie as a whole is cheap junk and an insult to their death-defying efforts .
6923	positive	Ryan Gosling ... is at 22 a powerful young actor .
7062	negative	The characters are paper thin and the plot is so cliched and contrived that it makes your least favorite James Bond movie seem as cleverly plotted as The Usual Suspects .
3089	negative	I do n't blame Eddie Murphy but should n't Owen Wilson know a movie must have a story and a script ?
4391	negative	Like a medium-grade network sitcom -- mostly inoffensive , fitfully amusing , but ultimately so weightless that a decent draft in the auditorium might blow it off the screen .
3731	positive	There is greatness here .
7913	negative	As if Drop Dead Gorgeous was n't enough , this equally derisive clunker is fixated on the spectacle of small-town competition .
563	negative	Green ruins every single scene he 's in , and the film , while it 's not completely wreaked , is seriously compromised by that .
801	positive	Gives an intriguing twist to the French coming-of-age genre .
8379	neutral	this film is not a love letter for the slain rappers , it 's a taunt - a call for justice for two crimes from which many of us have not yet recovered .

431	negative	frustratingly refuses to give Pinochet 's crimes a political context
359	neutral	Not as good as the original , but what is ...

1121	negative	There might be some sort of credible gender-provoking philosophy submerged here , but who the hell cares ?
7248	positive	Twohy knows how to inflate the mundane into the scarifying , and gets full mileage out of the rolling of a stray barrel or the unexpected blast of a phonograph record .
7921	positive	, `` They 're out there ! ''
6786	positive	Twenty years later , E.T. is still a cinematic touchstone .
7654	neutral	Very well made , but does n't generate a lot of tension .
3386	negative	As the sulking , moody male hustler in the title role , -LRB- Franco -RRB- has all of Dean 's mannerisms and self-indulgence , but none of his sweetness and vulnerability .
1601	neutral	On a certain base level , Blue Crush delivers what it promises , just not well enough to recommend it .
8274	negative	Boy , has this franchise ever run out of gas .
169	neutral	Those who love Cinema Paradiso will find the new scenes interesting , but few will find the movie improved .
3328	negative	Meyjes 's movie , like Max Rothman 's future , does not work .
1999	positive	A French film with a more down-home flavor .
4947	negative	Insufferably naive .
3024	neutral	Though it flirts with bathos and pathos and the further Oprahfication of the world as we know it , it still cuts all the way down to broken bone .
4483	negative	This low-rent -- and even lower-wit -- rip-off of the Farrelly brothers ' oeuvre gets way too mushy -- and in a relatively short amount of time .

2841	positive	The lightest , most breezy movie Steven Spielberg has made in more than a decade .
2073	neutral	Gorgeous scenes , masterful performances , but the sickly sweet gender normative narrative left an acrid test in this gourmet 's mouth .
5287	negative	A domestic melodrama with weak dialogue and biopic cliches .
8014	positive	A must for fans of British cinema , if only because so many titans of the industry are along for the ride .
7212	negative	... too contrived to be as naturally charming as it needs to be .
3799	negative	Grating and tedious .
7858	negative	Feels familiar and tired .
7895	negative	If Hill is n't quite his generation 's Don Siegel -LRB- or Robert Aldrich -RRB- , it 's because there 's no discernible feeling beneath the chest hair ;
3317	negative	The movie 's ultimate point -- that everyone should be themselves -- is trite , but the screenwriter and director Michel Gondry restate it to the point of ridiculousness .
6838	positive	Writer\/director Alexander Payne -LRB- Election -RRB- and his co-writer Jim Taylor brilliantly employ their quirky and fearless ability to look American angst in the eye and end up laughing .
8531	neutral	Even if you have no interest in the gang-infested , East-vs .
4792	neutral	What might 've been an exhilarating exploration of an odd love triangle becomes a sprawl of uncoordinated vectors .

2411	negative	Kapur fails to give his audience a single character worth rooting for -LRB- or worth rooting against , for that matter -RRB- .

2028	negative	Belongs in the too-hot-for-TV direct-to-video\/DVD category , and this is why I have given it a one-star rating .
3067	positive	Its cast full of caffeinated comedy performances more than make up for its logical loopholes , which fly by so fast there 's no time to think about them anyway .
7207	positive	Hashiguchi covers this territory with wit and originality , suggesting that with his fourth feature -- the first to be released in the U.S. -- a major director is emerging in world cinema .
4068	neutral	If you 're a Crocodile Hunter fan , you 'll enjoy at least the `` real '' portions of the film .
674	neutral	Showtime 's starry cast could be both an asset and a detriment .
5698	positive	Drumline ably captures the complicated relationships in a marching band .

6784	positive	A different movie -- sometimes tedious -- by a director many viewers would like to skip but film buffs should get to know .
5759	negative	The one not-so-small problem with Expecting is that the entire exercise has no real point .
8385	negative	So much about the film is loopy and ludicrous ... that it could have been a hoot in a bad-movie way if the laborious pacing and endless exposition had been tightened .
2031	neutral	A punch line without a premise , a joke built entirely from musty memories of half-dimensional characters .
106	positive	A macabre and very stylized Swedish fillm about a modern city where all the religious and civic virtues that hold society in place are in tatters .
5614	negative	It is n't quite one of the worst movies of the year .
5527	neutral	` Tobey Maguire is a poster boy for the geek generation . '
7491	positive	The byplay and bickering between the now spy-savvy siblings , Carmen -LRB- Vega -RRB- and Juni -LRB- Sabara -RRB- Cortez , anchor the film in a very real and amusing give-and-take .
2858	neutral	` You 'll laugh for not quite and hour and a half , but come out feeling strangely unsatisfied .
5885	negative	The film starts promisingly , but the ending is all too predictable and far too cliched to really work .
4489	negative	Like the excruciating End of Days , Collateral Damage presents Schwarzenegger as a tragic figure , but sympathy really belongs with any viewer forced to watch him try out so many complicated facial expressions .
4748	negative	A mean-spirited film made by someone who surely read The Catcher in the Rye but clearly suffers from dyslexia
2528	negative	If Disney 's Cinderella proved that ' a dream is a wish your heart makes , ' then Cinderella II proves that a nightmare is a wish a studio 's wallet makes .
4069	positive	A compelling story of musical passion against governmental odds .
837	neutral	Once again , the intelligence of gay audiences has been grossly underestimated , and a meaty plot and well-developed characters have been sacrificed for skin and flash that barely fizzle .

2451	positive	Troubling and powerful .
3637	negative	Chen films the resolutely downbeat Smokers Only with every indulgent , indie trick in the book .
4936	negative	For a film about action , Ultimate X is the gabbiest giant-screen movie ever , bogging down in a barrage of hype .
6134	negative	The animation and game phenomenon that peaked about three years ago is actually dying a slow death , if the poor quality of Pokemon 4 Ever is any indication .
7543	positive	It 's a scorcher .

3522	negative	An awful snooze .
7287	neutral	Has its charming quirks and its dull spots .
3442	negative	Whenever you think you 've seen the end of the movie , we cut to a new scene , which also appears to be the end .
1487	positive	These characters are so well established that the gang feels comfortable with taking insane liberties and doing the goofiest stuff out of left field , and I 'm all for that .
8000	positive	A film with a great premise but only a great premise .
7549	negative	Features nonsensical and laughable plotting , wooden performances , ineptly directed action sequences and some of the worst dialogue in recent memory .
5752	neutral	Some motion pictures portray ultimate passion ; others create ultimate thrills .
2766	positive	Despite its old-hat set-up and predictable plot , Empire still has enough moments to keep it entertaining .
4158	positive	I simply ca n't recommend it enough .
8429	positive	A very charming and funny movie .
1187	negative	Like Rudy Yellow Lodge , Eyre needs to take a good sweat to clarify his cinematic vision before his next creation and remember the lessons of the trickster spider .
14	positive	Fresnadillo has something serious to say about the ways in which extravagant chance can distort our perspective and throw us off the path of good sense .

6689	positive	An energetic , violent movie with a momentum that never lets up .
3475	positive	Sensual , funny and , in the end , very touching .
7489	negative	The film ultimately offers nothing more than people in an urban jungle needing other people to survive ...
8348	positive	High Crimes steals so freely from other movies and combines enough disparate types of films that it ca n't help but engage an audience .
3238	negative	Resurrection has the dubious distinction of being a really bad imitation of the really bad Blair Witch Project .
3385	negative	Unspeakable , of course , barely begins to describe the plot and its complications .
870	positive	God bless Crudup and his aversion to taking the easy Hollywood road and cashing in on his movie-star gorgeousness .

7600	negative	This is the kind of movie where people who have never picked a lock do so easily after a few tries and become expert fighters after a few weeks .
8077	positive	Thirteen Conversations About One Thing lays out a narrative puzzle that interweaves individual stories , and , like a Mobius strip , elliptically loops back to where it began .
8192	neutral	The Lady and the Duke is Eric Rohmer 's economical antidote to the bloated costume drama
4071	neutral	Um , no. .

1468	positive	At 78 minutes it just zings along with vibrance and warmth .

1383	positive	A stirring tribute to the bravery and dedication of the world 's reporters who willingly walk into the nightmare of war not only to record the events for posterity , but to help us clearly see the world of our making .
47	positive	As tricky and satisfying as any of David Mamet 's airless cinematic shell games .
5568	negative	Full of the kind of obnoxious chitchat that only self-aware neurotics engage in .
2694	positive	The plot twists give I Am Trying to Break Your Heart an attraction it desperately needed .

3213	positive	Bravado Kathy !
903	neutral	Almost .
965	negative	But ... in trying to capture the novel 's deeper intimate resonances , the film has -- ironically - distanced us from the characters .
1067	negative	It does n't offer audiences any way of gripping what its point is , or even its attitude toward its subject .
34	neutral	There 's very little sense to what 's going on here , but the makers serve up the cliches with considerable dash .
957	neutral	Cacoyannis is perhaps too effective in creating an atmosphere of dust-caked stagnation and labored gentility .
709	positive	Jones ... makes a great impression as the writer-director of this little $ 1.8 million charmer , which may not be cutting-edge indie filmmaking but has a huge heart .
5674	negative	SC2 is an autopilot Hollywood concoction lacking in imagination and authentic Christmas spirit , yet it 's geared toward an audience full of masters of both .
2894	positive	A smart , steamy mix of road movie , coming-of-age story and political satire .

5010	positive	Much of The Lady and the Duke is about quiet , decisive moments between members of the cultural elite as they determine how to proceed as the world implodes .
4721	negative	An empty exercise , a florid but ultimately vapid crime melodrama with lots of surface flash but little emotional resonance .
5694	positive	Writer\/director David Caesar ladles on the local flavour with a hugely enjoyable film about changing times , clashing cultures and the pleasures of a well-made pizza .
7208	positive	A grittily beautiful film that looks , sounds , and feels more like an extended , open-ended poem than a traditionally structured story .
7657	negative	This is a film about the irksome , tiresome nature of complacency that remains utterly satisfied to remain the same throughout .
7490	positive	... `` Bowling for Columbine '' remains a disquieting and thought-provoking film ...
7659	positive	Stands as one of the year 's most intriguing movie experiences , letting its imagery speak for it while it forces you to ponder anew what a movie can be .
1522	positive	While Insomnia is in many ways a conventional , even predictable remake , Nolan 's penetrating undercurrent of cerebral and cinemantic flair lends -LRB- it -RRB- stimulating depth .
5200	neutral	I would be shocked if there was actually one correct interpretation , but that should n't make the movie or the discussion any less enjoyable .
6976	neutral	Ah , what the hell .
7271	neutral	They do a good job of painting this family dynamic for the audience but they tried to squeeze too many elements into the film .
3086	positive	Fessenden continues to do interesting work , and it would be nice to see what he could make with a decent budget .
4705	negative	... a cinematic disaster so inadvertently sidesplitting it 's worth the price of admission for the ridicule factor alone .
633	negative	Its impressive images of crematorium chimney fires and stacks of dead bodies are undermined by the movie 's presentation , which is way too stagy .
3253	positive	A sensitive , cultivated treatment of Greene 's work as well as a remarkably faithful one .
5867	negative	Offers no new insight on the matter , nor do its characters exactly spring to life .
4807	positive	One of the best rock documentaries ever .
3602	positive	The overall effect is awe and affection -- and a strange urge to get on a board and , uh , shred , dude .

1436	positive	The first Tunisian film I have ever seen , and it 's also probably the most good-hearted yet sensual entertainment I 'm likely to see all year .

2522	negative	Despite some charm and heart , this quirky soccer import is forgettable
8213	negative	The satire is unfocused , while the story goes nowhere .
5629	negative	The kind of film that leaves you scratching your head in amazement over the fact that so many talented people could participate in such an ill-advised and poorly executed idea .
4162	positive	In addition to scoring high for originality of plot -- putting together familiar themes of family , forgiveness and love in a new way -- Lilo & Stitch has a number of other assets to commend it to movie audiences both innocent and jaded .
1956	positive	Both Grant and Hoult carry the movie because they are believable as people -- flawed , assured of the wrong things , and scared to admit how much they may really need the company of others .
2820	positive	This is one of those rare docs that paints a grand picture of an era and makes the journey feel like a party .
3903	negative	The main story ... is compelling enough , but it 's difficult to shrug off the annoyance of that chatty fish .
3273	negative	One problem with the movie , directed by Joel Schumacher , is that it jams too many prefabricated story elements into the running time .
6925	negative	Every joke is repeated at least -- annoying , is n't it ?
2359	negative	In the era of The Sopranos , it feels painfully redundant and inauthentic .
6738	positive	A suffocating rape-payback horror show that hinges on the subgenre 's most enabling victim ... and an ebullient affection for industrial-model meat freezers .
4916	positive	There is a certain sense of experimentation and improvisation to this film that may not always work , but it is nevertheless compelling .
811	negative	It gives poor Dana Carvey nothing to do that is really funny , and then expects us to laugh because he acts so goofy all the time .
2590	negative	Choppy , overlong documentary about ` The Lifestyle . '
5597	negative	With flashbulb editing as cover for the absence of narrative continuity , Undisputed is nearly incoherent , an excuse to get to the closing bout ... by which time it 's impossible to care who wins .
8181	negative	Unless Bob Crane is someone of particular interest to you , this film 's impressive performances and adept direction are n't likely to leave a lasting impression .
3987	negative	It does n't make for great cinema , but it is interesting to see where one 's imagination will lead when given the opportunity .
5172	negative	Yet why it fails is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma .
1681	negative	Much of the cast is stiff or just plain bad .
5328	negative	This is a remake by the numbers , linking a halfwit plot to a series of standup routines in which Wilson and Murphy show how funny they could have been in a more ambitious movie .
1099	negative	The nonstop artifice ultimately proves tiresome , with the surface histrionics failing to compensate for the paper-thin characterizations and facile situations .
6929	positive	If you 're part of her targeted audience , you 'll cheer .
8529	positive	The underworld urban angst is derivative of Martin Scorsese 's Taxi Driver and Goodfellas , but this film speaks for itself .
6671	negative	Something has been lost in the translation ... another routine Hollywood frightfest in which the slack execution italicizes the absurdity of the premise .
4848	negative	Even if it made its original release date last fall , it would 've reeked of a been-there , done-that sameness .
6327	positive	The story is smart and entirely charming in intent and execution .
1961	neutral	directed in a flashy , empty sub-music video style by a director so self-possessed he actually adds a period to his first name
6617	positive	A film of quiet power .
6968	positive	It 's refreshing that someone understands the need for the bad boy ; Diesel , with his brawny frame and cool , composed delivery , fits the bill perfectly .
725	neutral	Same song , second verse , coulda been better , but it coulda been worse .
1779	neutral	I saw Juwanna Mann so you do n't have to .
4367	neutral	This version of H.G. Wells ' Time Machine was directed by H.G. Wells ' great-grandson .
6410	negative	You 'll feel like you ate a Reeses without the peanut butter ... '
1656	negative	No better or worse than ` Truth or Consequences , N.M. ' or any other interchangeable actioner with imbecilic Mafia toolbags botching a routine assignment in a Western backwater .

557	negative	Make Chan 's action sequences boring .
6478	positive	Another Best of the Year selection .
7694	neutral	At its worst the screenplay is callow , but at its best it is a young artist 's thoughtful consideration of fatherhood .
962	positive	Horrid little propaganda film with fascinating connections not only to the Serbs themselves but also to a network of American right-wing extremists .
4781	negative	High Crimes is a cinematic misdemeanor , a routine crime thriller remarkable only for its lack of logic and misuse of two fine actors , Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd .
6291	positive	A great cast and a wonderful but sometimes confusing flashback movie about growing up in a dysfunctional family .
176	negative	Starts out mediocre , spirals downward , and thuds to the bottom of the pool with an utterly incompetent conclusion .
3283	positive	A culture-clash comedy that , in addition to being very funny , captures some of the discomfort and embarrassment of being a bumbling American in Europe .
1010	negative	Stone seems to have a knack for wrapping the theater in a cold blanket of urban desperation .
6487	positive	However , it 's pleasant enough and its ecological , pro-wildlife sentiments are certainly welcome .
4106	positive	Laugh-out-loud lines , adorably ditsy but heartfelt performances , and sparkling , bittersweet dialogue that cuts to the chase of the modern girl 's dilemma .
7568	negative	The action scenes have all the suspense of a 20-car pileup , while the plot holes are big enough for a train car to drive through -- if Kaos had n't blown them all up .
8297	positive	A delicious , quirky movie with a terrific screenplay and fanciful direction by Michael Gondry .
4272	neutral	It 's sincere to a fault , but , unfortunately , not very compelling or much fun .
1990	positive	I liked About Schmidt a lot , but I have a feeling that I would have liked it much more if Harry & Tonto never existed .
5613	positive	Everyone 's insecure in Lovely and Amazing , a poignant and wryly amusing film about mothers , daughters and their relationships .
7693	positive	It 's secondary to American Psycho but still has claws enough to get inside you and stay there for a couple of hours .
552	negative	While the story is better-focused than the incomprehensible Anne Rice novel it 's based upon , Queen Of The Damned is a pointless , meandering celebration of the goth-vampire , tortured woe-is-me lifestyle .
390	negative	The town has kind of an authentic feel , but each one of these people stand out and everybody else is in the background and it just seems manufactured to me and artificial .
3548	positive	Ian Holm conquers France as an earthy Napoleon
4325	positive	The movie is so thoughtlessly assembled .
2931	neutral	Well , it 's not as pathetic as The Animal .
7398	negative	You see the movie and you think , zzzzzzzzz .
712	negative	You can practically hear George Orwell turning over .
6346	neutral	Cinematic pratfalls given a working over .
1263	positive	Where Janice Beard falters in its recycled aspects , implausibility , and sags in pace , it rises in its courageousness , and comedic employment .
6637	neutral	An amalgam of The Fugitive , Blade Runner , and Total Recall , only without much energy or tension .
3161	negative	How many more times will indie filmmakers subject us to boring , self-important stories of how horrible we are to ourselves and each other ?
3354	positive	A journey spanning nearly three decades of bittersweet camaraderie and history , in which we feel that we truly know what makes Holly and Marina tick , and our hearts go out to them as both continue to negotiate their imperfect , love-hate relationship .
6624	negative	I 'm not sure which half of Dragonfly is worse : The part where nothing 's happening , or the part where something 's happening , but it 's stupid .
242	negative	Feels strangely hollow at its emotional core .
4876	negative	After sitting through this sloppy , made-for-movie comedy special , it makes me wonder if Lawrence hates criticism so much that he refuses to evaluate his own work .
6713	neutral	It 's another retelling of Alexandre Dumas ' classic .
2106	positive	A small movie with a big impact .
765	positive	You can sip your vintage wines and watch your Merchant Ivory productions ; I 'll settle for a nice cool glass of iced tea and a Jerry Bruckheimer flick any day of the week .
3259	positive	Unfolds in a low-key , organic way that encourages you to accept it as life and go with its flow .
3154	neutral	What makes the movie work -- to an admittedly limited extent -- is the commitment of two genuinely engaging performers .
6154	positive	A solid cast , assured direction and complete lack of modern day irony .
3907	positive	May not be a breakthrough in filmmaking , but it is unwavering and arresting .
7301	negative	... too sappy for its own good .
5115	negative	A bland animated sequel that hardly seems worth the effort .
8355	positive	A quietly moving look back at what it was to be Iranian-American in 1979 .
1462	negative	Even the hastily and amateurishly drawn animation can not engage .
5126	neutral	A Jewish WW II doc that is n't trying simply to out-shock , out-outrage or out-depress its potential audience !
2598	positive	Despite an overwrought ending , the film works as well as it does because of the performances .
4360	negative	Originality is sorely lacking .
8476	negative	The idea is more interesting than the screenplay , which lags badly in the middle and lurches between not-very-funny comedy , unconvincing dramatics and some last-minute action strongly reminiscent of Run Lola Run .
7163	neutral	The animation is competent , and some of the gags are quite funny , but Jonah ... never shakes the oppressive , morally superior good-for-you quality that almost automatically accompanies didactic entertainment .
5289	negative	May cause you to bite your tongue to keep from laughing at the ridiculous dialog or the oh-so convenient plot twists .
805	negative	White has n't developed characters so much as caricatures , one-dimensional buffoons that get him a few laughs but nothing else .
7630	negative	By no means a slam-dunk and sure to ultimately disappoint the action fans who will be moved to the edge of their seats by the dynamic first act , it still comes off as a touching , transcendent love story .
3673	negative	Shot like a postcard and overacted with all the boozy self-indulgence that brings out the worst in otherwise talented actors ...
6951	negative	Some of the characters die and others do n't , and the film pretends that those living have learned some sort of lesson , and , really , nobody in the viewing audience cares .
7832	positive	Darkly funny and frequently insightful .
2575	negative	It 's just that it 's so not-at-all-good .
6545	negative	What you expect is just what you get ... assuming the bar of expectations has n't been raised above sixth-grade height .
4333	neutral	Yes they can swim , the title is merely Anne-Sophie Birot 's off-handed way of saying girls find adolescence difficult to wade through .
5452	negative	Kapur weighs down the tale with bogus profundities .
5355	negative	Although it starts off so bad that you feel like running out screaming , it eventually works its way up to merely bad rather than painfully awful .
5842	negative	That chirpy songbird Britney Spears has popped up with more mindless drivel .
3482	positive	Insomnia is one of the year 's best films and Pacino gives one of his most daring , and complicated , performances .
4067	neutral	It 's fitfully funny but never really takes off .
4639	positive	The picture uses humor and a heartfelt conviction to tell a story about discovering your destination in life , but also acknowledging the places , and the people , from whence you came .
1809	positive	Bill Morrison 's Decasia is uncompromising , difficult and unbearably beautiful .
1017	negative	Any attempts at nuance given by the capable cast is drowned out by director Jon Purdy 's sledgehammer sap .

6005	neutral	At its best -LRB- and it does have some very funny sequences -RRB- Looking for Leonard reminds you just how comically subversive silence can be .
572	positive	Audiard successfully maintains suspense on different levels throughout a film that is both gripping and compelling .

5437	negative	overstylized
5296	positive	Holland lets things peter out midway , but it 's notably better acted -- and far less crass - than some other recent efforts in the burgeoning genre of films about black urban professionals .

6394	positive	If Ayurveda can help us return to a sane regimen of eating , sleeping and stress-reducing contemplation , it is clearly a good thing .

1406	negative	It wears its heart on the sleeve of its gaudy Hawaiian shirt .
3823	positive	And yet , it still works .
7633	positive	It 's about issues most adults have to face in marriage and I think that 's what I liked about it -- the real issues tucked between the silly and crude storyline .

1452	positive	As a film director , LaBute continues to improve .

3705	positive	Jackie Chan movies are a guilty pleasure - he 's easy to like and always leaves us laughing .
488	negative	There 's no point of view , no contemporary interpretation of Joan 's prefeminist plight , so we 're left thinking the only reason to make the movie is because present standards allow for plenty of nudity .
5860	positive	A keep - 'em - guessing plot and an affectionate take on its screwed-up characters .
5635	negative	Content merely to lionize its title character and exploit his anger - all for easy sanctimony , formulaic thrills and a ham-fisted sermon on the need for national health insurance .

5879	negative	The film is so packed with subplots involving the various Silbersteins that it feels more like the pilot episode of a TV series than a feature film .
5957	negative	The metaphors are provocative , but too often , the viewer is left puzzled by the mechanics of the delivery .
2015	positive	Birthday Girl lucks out with Chaplin and Kidman , who are capable of anteing up some movie star charisma when they need it to sell us on this twisted love story , but who can also negotiate the movie 's darker turns .
2610	positive	For VeggieTales fans , this is more appetizing than a side dish of asparagus .
4097	negative	The pairing does sound promising in theory ... but their lack of chemistry makes Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro in Showtime look like old , familiar vaudeville partners .

1333	negative	For all its violence , the movie is remarkably dull with only Caine making much of an impression .
3883	positive	What 's most refreshing about Real Women Have Curves is its unforced comedy-drama and its relaxed , natural-seeming actors .
1493	negative	Starts out strongly before quickly losing its focus , point and purpose in a mess of mixed messages , over-blown drama and Bruce Willis with a scar .
